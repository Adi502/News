Delhi HC asks excise dept to look into complaints of ‘unauthorised’ bars in Humayunpur village,"The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the Delhi government’s excise department to look into allegations of unauthorised clubs, bars and pubs being run in the city’s Humayunpur village, Safdarjung Enclave, without an excise licence.

A division bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Mini Pushkarna, hearing a plea moved by advocate Prashant Kumar Umrao, was informed by the petitioner’s counsel that there were clubs/bars, which are being run allegedly in the basements of Humayunpur village without an excise licence or fire safety permissions.

Pointing to certain “flyers” relating to a few of these establishments, the counsel argued that Halloween parties had recently been organised at some of these places, adding the roads there are so narrow that even fire tenders can’t enter in case of an emergency.

While perusing through a status report submitted by the Delhi government’s Department of Excise, the bench expressed its concern observing that the “status report does not inspire confidence” while noting that the department had visited the establishments and “found nothing”.

“It can’t be that there are flyers and you are saying that you haven’t even found a bottle. What is happening? Something seems to be amiss. It is a very serious matter. There can’t be such a wide gap or variation in facts. Some of the joints are running without a fire exit. What if someone dies? How will people exit?” the bench remarked orally.

The counsel for the Delhi government said that there was only one establishment against which an FIR has been registered as liquor was not found on the premises of others, adding certain places were also found locked during inspection.

The HC, thereafter, orally asked the excise department to conduct a check at the establishments in the area again and listed the matter for further hearing on December 14.

The counsel appearing for certain establishments who have been impleaded as parties in the matter argued that his clients are small eating joints and coffee shops, which do not serve alcohol.

In its plea, the petitioner has claimed that these pubs, operating in a residential area, have become a “source of nuisance” not only for the residents of the neighbouring area but also for the people such as him who visit the nearby public places.

The plea further stated that the locals have often allegedly witnessed public nuisance in the form of fights between people in an intoxicated state while coming out of the clubs/bars. It also claimed that these places play loud music which further causes difficulty for local residents.",Cities
Sena MLAs Disqualification hearing: Shinde Sena says whip issued by Uddhav camp bogus,"For the second consecutive day, Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA and party’s chief whip in legislative Assembly Sunil Prabhu was cross examined by the lawyer representing Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena Wednesday during the hearing of Sena MLAs’ disqualification pleas.

During the cross examination, Shinde-led Sena’s lawyer Mahesh Jethmalaani questioned Prabhu about the whip he claimed to have issued last year on June 21 when a group of MLAs led by Shinde launched rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena and went to Surat in Gujarat.

After the hearing Jethmalani alleged that the whole case is based on the claim of whip issued by the Sena UBT and it was defied but no such whip was issued and the whip which Sena UBT is claiming to has been issued is forged one.

“The whip shown by them(Sena UBT in its submission) is bogus. It’s forgery. Their whole disqualification petition is based on that the whip, that was issued on June 21 according to which the MLAs had to attend a meeting but that was not followed. But we have made a ground during the hearing that the whip of Sunil Prabhu was forged one and it was never issued or sent,” Jethmalani said.

Replying to the allegations of Jethmalani, Sena UBT MP Anil Desai said that the whip is issued by a party for its legislators and questioned how can a lawyer raise a question on its validity or call it bogus.

“The whip is genuine and the attempts made by their (Shinde led Sena’s ) lawyer would not be succeeded to prove the whip a bogus one,” Desai said.

During the hearing on Wednesday, Jethmalani questioned Prabhu, about the details of whip which Prabhu claimed to have issued to Sena MLAs to attend the party’s meeting on June 21, 2022.

The cross examination over the whip issued to Sena MLAs holds a lot of significance since the Sena UBT has filed a disqualification petitions against the Sena rebel MLAs claiming that the MLAs defied whip issued by Sena chief Whip to attend the meeting.

However, during the earlier hearing and in the submission in last month, the Shinde-led Sena had claimed that they never received any whip as claimed by Sena UBT and hence there is no question of defying the whip and there is no question of disqualification.

During the hearing the Jethmalani questioned Prabhu about when and how the whip was issued to the MLAs and whether he has received copy of whip from the MLAs, in order to prove that the whip was forged and was not even issued.

While replying to the questions, an official said, Prabhu replied saying that whip was signed and issued him on June 20, 2022. However, it was in the intervening night of June 20 and 21 and hence it was dated June 21 and issued physically to those Sena MLAs who were present in the office and at MLA guest house.

However, those MLAs who were missing or untraceable were sent the whip through WhatsApp, the official quoted Prabhu as saying.

On Tuesday, Sena lawyer had begin cross examination of Prabhu and started recording his statement.

During the cross examination on Tuesday, Prabhu asserted that the Sena MLAs who went to Surat and then Guwahati in June 2022 along with Shinde were under pressure by the BJP and there was a discussion that the MLAs were abducted.

The cross examination will continue for the next couple of days.

Meanwhile Speaker Rahul Narwekar who is holding the hearing, expressed his displeasure over the slow proceeding.

Narwekar said that they have only 16 days of time and with this pace of hearing the adjudication of the matter may be delayed and they may not be able to meet the deadline set by the Supreme Court.

Setting the timeline, the Supreme Court last month directed Narwekar to adjudicate disqualification petitions of rebel Sena MLAs by December 31.",Cities

Sarod maestro Amjad Ali adorns Namdhari style turban at Bhaini Sahib in Ludhiana,"It was not just a musical delight for the audience in Ludhiana last weekend when renowned Sarod maestro Amjad Ali Khan performed in front of them but also a visual spectacle. As usual the legendary Sarod player mesmerised the audience with his soulful performance, but watching him perform adorning the traditional Namdhari Sikh style of turban was the real icing on the cake.

The double delight came at the 11th Sri Satguru Jagjit Singh Sangeet Sammelan held in Sri Bhaini Sahib here on Sunday.

After the event, the musical genius wrote on his official Facebook page: “Heartfelt thanks to Rachpal Singh Ji for bestowing upon me the Namdhari turban- a profound gesture that echoes with history and cultural significance. The honor of wearing this turban emblematic symbol is truly humbling, and it deepens my connection to tradition.”

The musical extravaganza also showcased the exceptional talents of several young performers alongside established music legends. In his opening remarks, Amjad Ali Khan acknowledged the commendable contributions of late Namdhari sect leader Jagjit Singh to the advancement of Indian classical music during his lifetime. Drawing a poignant connection to his own heritage, Amjad Ali Khan shared that his ancestors wore Safa turbans, and as a gesture of respect, he chose to wear the Namdhari Sikh turban as a tribute to the legacy of the Namdhari sect.

Amidst contemporary challenges faced by Punjab, such as issues related to drug abuse, the glorification of gun culture in popular music, and radicalism, spiritual places like Sri Bhaini Sahib stand as beacons of pristine Indic culture, showcasing a commitment to its preservation for the greater societal good, said Dr Pushpinder Singh,

Member, Central Committee, Vishwa Namdhari Vidyak Jatha, while speaking to The Indian Express.

Amjad Ali Khan’s performance, dedicated to world peace, aligned with the ongoing efforts of the Namdhari Sangat, which has been performing recitals of “Chandi di Vaar” since November 15 for international peace. The fusion of Gurbani recitation and melodic compositions during the concert created an enchanting ambience in Sri Bhaini Sahib.

Bhaini Sahib stands out as one of the rare places in the country where Indic traditions are not only preserved but actively practised in the daily lives of the Namdhari Sikhs. It offers a meaningful response to the pervasive colonial influences of the past and the detrimental impacts of contemporary consumerism on society. From its role in the post-1857 rallying for India’s independence to providing solace during challenging times like the Partition, the place has been a testament to resilience, said Dr Pushpinder Singh.",Cities

Odd bloodstain on wall prompts Pune police to probe murder in drowning death,"Probe suggests that Ghule forcibly took Dhotre to the tank below ground level, which has a tin lid in the corner within the house premises, and drowned him. ""He returned to his room and went to sleep,"" said the inspector.

A bloodstain at an odd spot on the wall next to the lid of a water tank prompted Pune police to launch a murder investigation into the death of a 50-year-old labourer which prima facie seemed accidental. A probe has revealed that he was murdered by his 37-year-old tenant over a dispute stemming from the noise of the two-wheeler engine revving.

"Fadnavis hails self-styled Godman, Oppn says BJP needs ‘babas’ to divide people on caste lines during polls","DEPUTY Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis today met self-styled godman Acharya Dhirendra Shastri, better known as Bageshwar Dham Sarkar, at his ‘durbar’ and sought blessings by touching his feet. While Fadnavis eulogised Shastri, lauding his work to protect Sanatan Dharma, Opposition parties—NCP and Sena (UBT)— said Fadnavis and BJP needed ”such babas who divide people based on caste.”

Fadnavis, accompanied by cabinet colleague Chandrakant Patil, visited Sangamwadi area where Shastri is ‘holding court’. Fadnavis wasted no time in bowing before Shastri to seek blessings.

Shastri said that those who are “Ram bhakts belong to everyone. I am not praising Fadnavis because he is the Deputy CM but because he is a Ram bhakt.”

Not to be outdone, Fadnavis returned the compliments by praising Shastri’s work towards awareness about Sanatan Dharma. “Some people are spreading misinformation. They say Sanatan means rigid customs and casteism. They don’t understand the real meaning. Sanatan means eternal, one which will not end. And this is the tenet of Bharat which ties everyone together, with no upper or lower class…”

“Bageshwar baba is creating awareness about Santan Dharma as per which we are all children of God. If India is awakened, the world will awaken. Pune residents are fortunate to have baba admist them,” Fadnavis added.

NCP leader Jitendra Ahwad, from Sharad Pawar faction, said that during every election, they (BJP) need a baba. “Unfortunately, wherein Maharashtra has a tradition of saints with a progressive mindset, BJP needs babas who believe in castiesm. Shastri is not a saint, but BJP is projecting him as one.”

Sena (UBT) spokesperson Sanjay Raut slammed Fadnavis over his lack of judgment. “Before bowing to Shastri, Fadnavis should have given a thought to Shastri’s objectionable statements against Sant Tukaram, Lord Ram and his father Dashrath. Let Fadnavis go by his Hindutva, we will practice ours.”

Independent MLA Bachchu Kadu said that Maharashtra seemed to be moving on a different path these days. “Fadnavis may be in awe of Shastri. It is his individual decision,” Kadu said.

Earlier, Ajit-led NCP and Maharashtra Andhashradha Nirmolan Samiti had opposed Shastri’s event which is being held in Sangamwadi area.",Cities
Maharashtra: Panel submits report on OPS implementation,"A three-member committee appointed by the Eknath Shinde government to submit a report on its recommendations about the implementation of Old Pension Scheme (OPS) in Maharashtra, submitted its report Wednesday to Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar.

In March 2023, after the strike called by state government employees, Shinde had announced the setting up of a committee comprising former senior bureaucrats Subodh Kumar, K P Bakshi and Sudhir Kumar Shrivastava to study old and new pension schemes.

Deputy Chief Minister and then Finance minister Devendra Fadnavis had said that the government was not opposed to the implementation of OPS in principle and wanted to study the effects of its financial burden on the state and wanted to take decisions after properly studying it.

Maharashtra had become the first BJP-ruled state to positively consider OPS at the time when opposition Congress has been demanding implementation of the OPS across the country.

The state government will now study the report submitted by the committee and is likely to reach out to the decision.

However, Maharashtra government employee unions have already warned of strike from December 14 unless the government fails to announce the decision.

"TRB jawans relieved to make way for new recruits, says DGP; personnel step up protest","Amid rising protest, Director General of Police Vikas Sahay said Wednesday that the decision to relieve those who had served more than three years as Traffic Brigade (TRB) personnel was taken to make way for new people. It is not right to continue as a person on duty at one place for a long time, he added.

In reference to the November 19 notification to relieve the personnel who have been in service for more than three years, DGP Sahay told The Indian Express, “In our notification, we have clearly mentioned that those TRB Jawans who have been on duty for 10 years, 5 years and 3 years should be relieved in three stages. It is not correct administratively to let a person continue on duty for a long time at one place. Generally, in the police department, the cops serving in the traffic department get transferred in three years”.

According to the notification, those with 10 years of service will be relieved on November 30, while those with five years on December 31. Personnel with three years service will be relieved on March 31, 2024.

TRB jawans remain on road junctions and due to the pollution, it is not advisable as it affects their health conditions, the DGP added. “TRB is not an employment given for life-time but is contractual and they are hired on daily wages. We will fill the gap by recruiting new members as others should also be given a chance to work in the Traffic Brigade.”

Meanwhile, the protest by affected personnel reached the Surat Collectorate Wednesday where they handed over a memorandum to Surat Collector Ayush Oak demanding withdrawal of the notification and a wage hike from Rs 300 a day to Rs 450. The protesting personnel were accompanied by Congress leaders as they met Oak.

“We will fight for our rights as we have been relieved from duties without any suitable reason. We will stage dharna in the coming days with our family members, including children, and knock on the doors of the state government,” a TRB jawan from Surat said on the condition of anonymity.

The TRB jawans also sought common wages for all personnel across the state. A new uniform every two years, ID cards, compensation for jawans who die on duty and caps in place of helmets are the other demands.
