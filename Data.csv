Coach Igor Stimacï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s moves backfire as 0-3 defeat in World Cup qualifier to Qatar ends Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 15-game unbeaten,"It was hard to decipher Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s strategy against defending Asian champions Qatar at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. It was understandable that they wanted to defend against a team ranked 61st in the world, 41 places higher than them.
But in a vital FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier, India coach Igor Stimac decided to bench goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, undoubtedly the best player the last two times India faced the 2022 World Cup hosts. Not just that, the Croatian made four changes among the outfield players from the team that stunned Kuwait 1-0 in the opening game of the campaign.
The result of those changes was that India lacked coordination, especially when defending. And they were made to pay the price by their much taller, stronger, and in-sync opponents. The final scoreline read 0-3 but Stimac would know that the score couldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been much more humiliating had Qatar converted even half of the chances they created.

This was more than just a World Cup qualifier fowas also their toughest preparatory game ahead of the AFC Asian Cup in January, where similar or tougher tests await them. It was a chance for Stimac to show that India has attacking flair and a solid defence. But with Amrinder Singh replacing Gurpreet, the defence led by Sandesh Jhingan looked shaky from the start. Amrinder looked overawed by the occasion and responsibility. He had a nightmarish game with the ball at his feet, giving it away three times in the first half itself.
Qatar were coming from a 8-1 thrashing over Afghanistan. Coached by Carlos Queiroz, who has managed the likes of Iran, Portugal and Real Madrid, they almost took the lead in the second minute when a misplaced pass from Amrinder allowed their star striker Almoez Ali to walk into the Indian box and square it to Akram Afif.
Just about four yards in front of goal, Afif fluffed his chance to send it wide much to the relief of the packed Kalinga Stadium, which had former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in attendance.

It didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t take long for Qatar to redeem themselves, courtesy of some chaotic defending by India. Just two minutes later, India managed to head Afifï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s corner out of the box, only for a Qatari player to send it back in. The ball pinballed in the Indian box and Udanta Singhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s failed clearance was met by the quick Mostafa Meshaal, who sent into the bottom corner.

An early goal seemed to ease the pressure of the away match and Qatar kept displaying their attacking flair and prowess, launching attack after attack, with the Indian defence t.
Changes donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t work
In the defensive set-up, Stimac brought in Anirudh Thapa for Sahal Abdul Samad, and at left-back, he replaced Ashish Mishra with Subhasish Bose. Benching the in-form Mahesh Singh and starting with Udanta Singh was also a risk that didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t pay off as India didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t look threatening on counters.
It was only after the half-hour mark that India started showing glimpses of what they are capable of. Probably their best move of the match came in the 35th minute when Thapa and Udanta played a series of one-twos to enter the Qatar box before Thapa pulled it back for Apuia Ralte waiting at the top of the area. The Mumbai City FC playmaker, who was easily Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s best player in the match, skied his shot into the stands.

However, that attack gave India belief that they too could penetrate the Qatar defence, which leaked four goals against Iran in their last friendly.
Thapa had Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s best opportunity of the match in the 42nd minute when Sunil Chhetrob a Qatari defender and play the ball to Thapa.
With just the goalkeeper to beat, Thapa tried to be cheeky and poke the ball from the edge of the box, but it was well wide of the target.
Qatar doubled their lead in the first minute of the second half, as Almoez got on the scoresheet. Boualem Khouki sold Lallianzuala Chhangte a dummy and floated a lovely ball out to Afif waiting in the box. Afif smashed it at goal and Amrinder could only palm it under his body but Almoez, Qatarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s record goalscorer who scored four against Afghanistan, slid in to take his tally to 80 for his country.
Stimac made two changes early in the second half, bringing in Mahesh in place of Udanta at the start and getting Sahal in place of Thapa a little later. It was then that India started combining well and looked threatening. Sahal had a good chance in the 65th minute, finding himself in acres of space inside the box after a brilliant through ball by Suresh Singh, but he dragged his left-footed shot wide, probably not realisi much time he actually had.
Qatar put the game to bed in the 85th minute with substitute Yusuf Abdurisag scoring with the simplest of headers at the near post, and just like that, Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s
15-game unbeaten run at home was broken.

While they were certainly outplayed, they did show that it was possible to create chances against Asiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s best.

40-over games in ODI

As the World Cup has chugged along, there has been plenty of debate about the future of the 50-over format. The former India coach weighed in, suggesting that the format should be reduced to 40 overs. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think changes have to be made. When we won the World Cup in 83 it was a 60-over game it changed to 50 overs. You have to evolve with time, you have to see the attention span of the spectator. It is diminishing. I think the way forward would be a 40-over game.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Shastri also highlighted viewer behaviour of those who visit the grounds to watch their team play, saying they are interested in just certain phases of the format.

The Indian Express understands that Pandya will miss the upcoming T20I series at home against Australia and is also likely to miss three T20Is and three ODIs in South Africa.
The Baroda all-rounder lost his balance while trying to stop a shot from Bangladesh opener Liton Das and dragged his right boot while landing on the pitch. He got up and looked in discomfort as he stood on his haunches. Pandya was later rushed to the National Cricket Academy for rehabilitation and then ruled out from the ongoing World Cup.

ICC pitch consultant raises concerns about switching of pitch that might favour India if they reach ODI World Cup final,"ICC pitch consultant Andy Atkinson has raised questions whether the pitch for the final of the ICC World Cup to be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on November 19 will be prepared ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½without favouritismï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

The Daily Mail reported that Atkinson had flown to Ahmedabad last Friday to check on preparations for the final after being unsatisfied with the pitch changes being made to reportedly favour India, the home team.

The Indian Express reported on Tuesday that the Indian team management asked BCCI curators to shave off most of the grass on the Wankhede Stadium playing surface for their semifinal clash against New Zealand.

The management wanted a slow surface that will assist Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s world-class spinners.

India has performed well on slow tracks at home over the past few years. Before the World Cup, the team management had requested for their matches to be held on slow pitches.

Pitches at ICC events are prepared under the supervision of Atkinson, who agreeshe home board which of the numbered strips on the square will be used for each game.

The Daily Mail report however says that the Ahmedebad Stadium has played three of the four group games on different surfaces from those on the schedule. And Atkinson fears the same could happen if India reach the final on Sunday.

Atkinsonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s recommendation was that the final should be played on pitch No 5, which has been used only once, though he learned last week that pitch No 6 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which has been used twice ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ could get the nod to bring Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s spinners into play.

In his email, Atkinson warns: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As a result of these actions, one must speculate if this will be the first ever ICC CWC (cricket World Cup) final to have a pitch which has been specifically chosen and prepared to their stipulation at the request of the team management and/or the hierarchy of the home nation board.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

"IIT-Madras launches information platform on accelerators, incubators","The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madrasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Centre for Research on Start-ups and Risk Financing (CREST) has developed the countryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first information platform on incubators and accelerators.

The platform is developed in partnership with YNOS, an IIT Madras-incubated start-up. The information platform will contain comprehensive information on incubators and accelerators, which seeks to play an important role in helping start-ups navigate an uncertain entrepreneurial ecosystem.

India had about 1,000 active incubators, but until now, the information about them was scattered and not easily available in a single location, an IIT Madras statement said. Entrepreneurs, the institute said, had to spend a lot of time and effort to identify the incubator most suitable for their start-up.

The platform would address this pain point and help the start-up founders to identify, compare and analyse incubators very easily and would shortlist one that best fits their requirements.

The incorm has been developed using the latest technology tools to quickly analyse the incubator and accelerator landscape in India. It features intuitive filters on multiple incubator parameters to quickly identify the set of incubators that satisfy different criteria for shortlisting and a facility to bookmark shortlisted incubators for detailed assessment at a later stage.",Education

I said in Kolkata, the great man (Sachin Tendulkar) just congratulated me. All this feels like a dream, too good to be true. Feels surreal for me. Again a big game today, I had to play the role I have played throughout the tournament so that the guys around me can go and express themselves. Just glad everything came together so nicely and we put up a great total on the board as well. (On how he gets the consistency going) Most important thing is to make my team win and whatever it takes to do that I am ready to do that. Whether running singles and doubles, hitting boundaries... whatever the team wants me to do. I have been given a role this tournament and I have been trying to play that to the best of my abilities - try to dig deep and bat long so the guys around me can play around me and have that confidence in the later overs where I can dominate with the bat as well.

(On his celebration after reaching the hundred) As I said stuff of dreams. Anushka was sitting right there, Sachin paaji was here too. Difficult to explain this. If I could paint a perfect picture I would want this to be the picture. My life partner, the person I love the most is sitting there, my hero is sitting there and I was able to get the 50th (ODI hundred) in front of all of them and all these stands in Wankhede as well, such a history venue so it was amazing. (Assessing the team's innings) In a big game you are happy with anything over 330-340. To get close to 400 is amazing. Lot of credit has to go to Shreyas the way he came and batted freely.. Shubman and Rohit at the top, KL finishing with the flurry... I think everyone did their roles to perfection and did the job beautifully for the team. A perfect batting performance but just one half of the game is done. Still got to go out there and be professional with the ball and do the things we have done in the tournament so far.",Sports

JEE Main 2024: When should I start giving mock tests?,"ýýý Ajay Sharma
The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main is a highly competitive entrance test that opens the door to some of Indiaýýýs finest engineering colleges. Mock tests are an essential part of the preparation process for the aspiring engineers who invest years of time and energy into successfully passing this test. Weýýýll go into the importance of mock exams in this blog and when itýýýs best to include them in your JEE Main preparation plan.
Understanding the purpose of mock tests:
Mock tests are like practice runs for the real deal, offering students a chance to gauge their strengths and weaknesses, fine-tune their time management skills, and get comfortable with the exam format and atmosphere. They can also help boost confidence, minimize exam stress, and sharpen problem-solving abilities. Itýýýs clear that including mock tests in your study schedule is crucial for thorough preparation.
Early phase of preparation:
Advertisement
The journey to cracking JEE Main is a marathon, not a sprint. Beginning your mock test early in your preparation phase can provide you with important insights into your current level of understanding and identify areas that require more attention. Starting with mock tests in the early phase helps in preparing a base and understanding the exam pattern, making it easier to create a targeted study plan.
As a rule of thumb, initiating mock tests about 3 to 4 months before the actual examination can be beneficial. For example, in 2024, the first phase of JEE Main is scheduled in January, so the early phase for the same was around September to October. So those students who have already done this part or planning to do it now, have completed their early phase of preparation. This allows ample time for both self-study and targeted improvement based on your performance in the mock tests.
Mid-preparation phase:
The mid-phase of your JEE Main preparation gets increasingly important as you move forward because itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s when you may sharpen your abilities and adjust your strategies. Bypoint, you should have covered a significant portion of the syllabus. Incorporating mock tests into your routine during this stage helps you assess your progress, identify weak areas, and focus on refining your time management skills.
Around 2 to 3 months before the examination, consider taking full-length mock tests on a regular basis. This not only helps in building stamina for the lengthy exam but also provides a realistic preview of the actual test conditions. Analysing your performance in these mock tests will enable you to prioritize topics and allocate your study time more efficiently.

Just two days after former Test captain Mohammad Hafeez was entrusted the role of Team Director for the Pakistan menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s cricket team and Shan Masood and Shaheen Shah Afridi took over the reins of the national team from Babar Azam, the Pakistan Cricket Board picked two former Pakistan pacers to lead two crucial selection committees.
While former left-arm fast bowler Wahab Riaz was appointed as the chief selector of the national menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s selection committee, Sohail Tanvir was named as the head of the junior selection committee.

Riazï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first assignment will be the selection of the national menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s squad for the three-match Test series against Australia from December 14 to January 7 in Australia and the five-match T20I series against New Zealand from January 12 to 21 in New Zealand.

"ýýýPressureýýý from parents behind student suicides, says Supreme Court","ýýýIntense competitionýýý and ýýýpressureýýý of parents on their wards preparing for competitive exams are the main reasons for the rising number of suicides across the country, the Supreme Court said on Monday.
Hearing a plea that sought regulation of the mushrooming coaching institutes and cited the data on student suicides, a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti, however, expressed helplessness and said the judiciary cannot pass directions in such a scenario.
ýýýThese are not easy things. Pressure from parents is behind all these incidents. More than the children, it is the parents who are putting pressure on them. How can the court pass directions in such a scenario,ýýý the bench told advocate Mohini Priya, appearing for the petitioner ýýý Mumbai-based doctor Aniruddha Narayan Malpani.

Justice Khanna said, ýýýAlthough, most of us will not want any coaching institute to be there, but look at the conditions of schools. There is intense competition and students have no other option but to go to these coaching institutes.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Referring to the 2020 data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Priya said it highlights that around 8.2 per cent of students in the country die by suicide.
The bench said that it knows about the situation but the court canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t pass directions and suggested that the petitioner instead approach the government with his suggestions.
Priya sought to withdraw the plea to approach the appropriate forum, which the court allowed.
The plea filed by Malpani through Priya said that it seeks appropriate directions for regulating the conduct of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½profit-hungry private coaching institutes mushrooming across India which provide coaching for various competitive entrance examinations such as IIT-JEE (Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination) and NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Children as young as 14 years enter these coaching factories often away from their homes and undergo rigorous preparation in the anticipation of getting admission to a good medical or engineering college.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½After being in a protected home environment, the child is suddenly exposed to the harsh competitive world without being mentally equipped to do so. These profit-hungry coaching institutes, however, do not care about student well-being and are only focussed on minting money leading to the youth of India being pressurised enough to take their own lives,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the petition said.

It said that children are being made to live and study in these coaching factories in subpar and abnormal conditions which are severely affecting their mental health.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What is most dangerous about mental health is that it is invisible, unlike other ailments in our body. However, just like other phyproblems too are triggered by extrinsic forces, surrounding environment and pressures,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it said.
The plea said that student suicides were a grave human rights concern.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The lackadaisical attitude of the Centre in enacting a law despite the rising number of suicides clearly reflects upon the Stateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s apathy towards protecting these young minds who are the future of our country and their constitutional right to live with dignity guaranteed under Article 21,ï¿½",Education

After the match, the Aussie seamer spoke at length about the low-scoring thriller and the pitch at Eden Gardens.

And whilst it was pretty close, we had plenty of squeeze past and make to a final,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Starc said while speaking at the post-match press conference.
However, Starc was a bit surprised at the nature of the surface and said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yeah, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m certainly not going to say Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m one to read pitches and know what they do. I mean, training here the last few days, the practice wicket certainly turned a lot. From all reports, I think the wicket we played on has been used a few times so no surprise that it did turn. It is probably a little surprising that it did seam around a little bit whilst I said before it was pretty inconsistent pace wise, I think average first inning scores here have been sort of around 300 mark or a little bit higher. So yeah, a little bit surprising but you know sometimes itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s nice to see ball dominate bat.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
On a personal front with the ball, Starc, who picked 3/34, expressed happiness with his spell and said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yeah, thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s probably not been the tournament I would have liked from the get go br power play was probably what got us on our way. And there were other key moments through the day with bat and ball, but to start the game like that with Joshie [Hazelwood] and I, power play wickets have probably been not our strong suit through the tournament so itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s nice to have a power play of what two for 18 or something like that so the way Josh bowled throughout to finish two for 12 was incredible, and then Trav with bat and ball.

ely popular during the World Cup for introducing the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½best fielderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s medalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in the Indian dressing room, Dilip doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t have any cricketing background. With just tennis-ball cricket behind him, coaching became his calling from a young age. First up, he worked in age-group academies in Hyderabad before he got a chance to work with Deccan Chargers in the IPL. At the now- defunct franchise, he would get a chance to be with renowned baseball coach Mike Young, who coached Australia in the past. And from there on, his graph kept moving upward.

With no playing experience, Dilip would then enrol for a coaching programme at the NCA, where he would work with former India fielding coach R Sridhar. This was a period when he used to take maths tuitions to fund his coaching education and once he cleared the exams, became a regular face at the NCA. During the off-season, Dilip was a regular presence at the NCA zonal and annual camps, during which time he caught Dravidï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s eorked with Abhay Sharma as the fielding coach during his stints with five Under-19 and A teams, the former India captain handpicked Dilip for the national team. With the Indian team, apart from maintaining the fielding standards set by Sridhar, his biggest contribution is how he has turned KL Rahul into a thorough wicketkeeper. With unique coaching gear, he has been spending hours together to get Rahulï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s positioning right.

Toppersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tips: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I started CUET UG preparation after my bo,"Dishank Gandhi took the CUET in its debut edition in 2022. He appeared for four papers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ history, political science, English and psychology and topped the Common University Entrance Test UG with 800/800 marks.

He scored an overall pass percentage of 92 per cent in Class 10 and 94.8 per cent in Class 12. Currently pursuing BA (Hons) History from St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s College at Delhi University, the topper shares how he prepared for the CUET.

My CUET experience

I relied on self-study. Although I mainly focussed on NCERT books for CUET UG preparation, I did not keep my preparation strategy restricted. I delved deeper into concepts and topics. I used the internet to garner more knowledge on the topics in addition to the NCERTs.

I started my CUET preparation after my board exams were over. The only additional thing that I felt would require attention was the CBSE deleted portions. I did not want to complicate my board exams by including CUET preparation.

The entrance test was not diffict all the questions were directly related to the NCERT books. However, I was heavily impacted by the mismanagement of CUET. After coming out from my exam centre, I came to know that the paper got cancelled as many were unable to complete their biometric attendance. On the next day, I was affected by Covid. On the revised test date, I was ill and weak.

Why did I choose St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s College?

I chose St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s because it is one of the best colleges in India as per many rankings. St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s was my first preference. I also added some programmes of Hindu College as my preferences.

Advise for CUET UG aspirants

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Focus on the board exams first

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Do not complicate the board preparation by including CUET UG preparation pressure

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Try to be consistent with the preparation

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Focus on accumulating knowledge, rather than an exam

Life in St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s College

The highly renowned faculty goes out of their traditional roles as teachersther it is about studies, their future prospects or anything else.

After getting admission to St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s College, I am realising that the colleges do not matter as much as the programme. Internship and direct placement scopes are very low for a history student like me. So I have enrolled in several skill-enhancement courses like IT, coding, Java, SQL and Python programming languages.
