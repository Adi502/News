JEE Main 2024: When should I start giving mock tests?,"ýýý Ajay Sharma
The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main is a highly competitive entrance test that opens the door to some of Indiaýýýs finest engineering colleges. Mock tests are an essential part of the preparation process for the aspiring engineers who invest years of time and energy into successfully passing this test. Weýýýll go into the importance of mock exams in this blog and when itýýýs best to include them in your JEE Main preparation plan.
Understanding the purpose of mock tests:
Mock tests are like practice runs for the real deal, offering students a chance to gauge their strengths and weaknesses, fine-tune their time management skills, and get comfortable with the exam format and atmosphere. They can also help boost confidence, minimize exam stress, and sharpen problem-solving abilities. Itýýýs clear that including mock tests in your study schedule is crucial for thorough preparation.
Early phase of preparation:

The journey to cracking JEE Main is a marathon, not a sprint. Beginning your mock test early in your preparation phase can provide you with important insights into your current level of understanding and identify areas that require more attention. Starting with mock tests in the early phase helps in preparing a base and understanding the exam pattern, making it easier to create a targeted study plan.
As a rule of thumb, initiating mock tests about 3 to 4 months before the actual examination can be beneficial. For example, in 2024, the first phase of JEE Main is scheduled in January, so the early phase for the same was around September to October. So those students who have already done this part or planning to do it now, have completed their early phase of preparation. This allows ample time for both self-study and targeted improvement based on your performance in the mock tests.
Mid-preparation phase:
The mid-phase of your JEE Main preparation gets increasingly important as you move forward because itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s when you may sharpen your abilities and adjust ypoint, you should have covered a significant portion of the syllabus. Incorporating mock tests into your routine during this stage helps you assess your progress, identify weak areas, and focus on refining your time management skills.
Around 2 to 3 months before the examination, consider taking full-length mock tests on a regular basis. This not only helps in building stamina for the lengthy exam but also provides a realistic preview of the actual test conditions. Analysing your performance in these mock tests will enable you to prioritize topics and allocate your study time more efficiently.

"ýýýPressureýýý from parents behind student suicides, says Supreme Court","ýýýIntense competitionýýý and ýýýpressureýýý of parents on their wards preparing for competitive exams are the main reasons for the rising number of suicides across the country, the Supreme Court said on Monday.
Hearing a plea that sought regulation of the mushrooming coaching institutes and cited the data on student suicides, a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti, however, expressed helplessness and said the judiciary cannot pass directions in such a scenario.
ýýýThese are not easy things. Pressure from parents is behind all these incidents. More than the children, it is the parents who are putting pressure on them. How can the court pass directions in such a scenario,ýýý the bench told advocate Mohini Priya, appearing for the petitioner ýýý Mumbai-based doctor Aniruddha Narayan Malpani.

Justice Khanna said, ýýýAlthough, most of us will not want any coaching institute to be there, but look at the conditions of schools. There is intense competition and students have no other option but to go to these coaching institutes.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Referring to the 2020 data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Priya said it highlights that around 8.2 per cent of students in the country die by suicide.
The bench said that it knows about the situation but the court canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t pass directions and suggested that the petitioner instead approach the government with his suggestions.
Priya sought to withdraw the plea to approach the appropriate forum, which the court allowed.
The plea filed by Malpani through Priya said that it seeks appropriate directions for regulating the conduct of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½profit-hungry private coaching institutes mushrooming across India which provide coaching for various competitive entrance examinations such as IIT-JEE (Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination) and NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½After being in a protected home environment, the child is suddenly exposed to the harsh competitive world without being mentally equipped to do so. These profit-hungry coaching institutes, however, do not care about student well-being and are only focussed on minting money leading to the youth of India being pressurised enough to take their own lives,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the petition said.

Toppersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tips: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I sta,"Dishank Gandhi took the CUET in its debut edition in 2022. He appeared for four papers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ history, political science, English and psychology and topped the Common University Entrance Test UG with 800/800 marks.

He scored an overall pass percentage of 92 per cent in Class 10 and 94.8 per cent in Class 12. Currently pursuing BA (Hons) History from St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s College at Delhi University, the topper shares how he prepared for the CUET.

My CUET experience

I relied on self-study. Although I mainly focussed on NCERT books for CUET UG preparation, I did not keep my preparation strategy restricted. I delved deeper into concepts and topics. I used the internet to garner more knowledge on the topics in addition to the NCERTs.

Advertisement

I started my CUET preparation after my board exams were over. The only additional thing that I felt would require attention was the CBSE deleted portions. I did not want to complicate my board exams by including CUET preparatiot all the questions were directly related to the NCERT books. However, I was heavily impacted by the mismanagement of CUET. After coming out from my exam centre, I came to know that the paper got cancelled as many were unable to complete their biometric attendance. On the next day, I was affected by Covid. On the revised test date, I was ill and weak.

Why did I choose St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s College?

I chose St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s because it is one of the best colleges in India as per many rankings. St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s was my first preference. I also added some programmes of Hindu College as my preferences.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Do not complicate the board preparation by including CUET UG preparation pressure

After getting admission to St Stephenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s College, I am realising that the colleges do not matter as much as the programme.

IIFT exam 2015: All You Need to Know About the Test Pattern,"The IIFT entrance exam is scheduled for November 22, 2015. We tell you what would be the general pattern of the exam. Take a look.

The general pattern includes four sections ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ General Awareness, English Usage, Reading Comprehension (sub part of section 2), Logical Reasoning, Data Interpretation and Quantitative Ability (sub part of section 4). Overall 118-128 questions are asked where attempting 80 is counted good.

The first section has 25-30 questions and relatively takes less time. The second section includes a total number of 40-45 questions and is divided in two sub parts. Part 1 is English Usage and part 2 Reading Comprehension. You can score a good 16 marks by dedicating not more than 25 minutes to this section.

IIFT is a two hour exam and therefore is a test of speed. As there is a differential marking scheme, the candidate should lay emphasis on solving more questions from the sections in which each question carries more weightage.

The candidates who clear the cut-off are shortlisted for the further stages of the selection procedure. The shortlisted candidates are then called for Essay GD-PI round. The Essay GD-PI is usually conducted in the month of Feb-March.

The only coaching staff to be associated with this team since Ravi Shastri & his men left the space. From the time he came on board after the previous World Cup, he has been harping about the need to be a lot more aggressive with the bat. And it is only at this World Cup that the world got to see the true potential and might of Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s line-up.
Not the most gifted batsman during his playing days, after hanging up his boots, Rathour spent a few years in England before returning to coach Punjab and national selector when Virat Kohli was captain. The 54-year-old is at the forefront of Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s training sessions, where he usually makes the schedule. A firm believer in giving batsmen freedom to go for shots irrespective of the format, Rathour has publicly backed the likes of Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer when they have been dismissed going for the big shots in Tests.

Not known to tinker much with their technique, but also the first to jump in and have a say at the nets if he sees something missing. To make it easier for the players, he instructs the teamï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s data analyst to video-record their net sessions and play it later on. He is known to seldom show his emotions and was even tipped to take a top role at the NCA.

Afghanistan to tour India for three-T20I series in January ahead of England Test series,"ýýýIndia, we are coming again!ýýý
Afghanistan Cricket Board would let know via their social media. Having impressed with their takedown of former World Cup champions in England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Afghanistan will visit the country in January for a three-match T20I series.
The first of the three games shall be played on January 11, 14 and 17. The series will be sandwiched between the Indiaýýýs tour of South Africa ýýý three T20Is, as many ODIs and two Tests ýýý and the five-Test series against England at home starting early February.

Coach Igor Stimacï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s moves backfire as 0-3 defeat in World Cup qualifier to Qatar ends Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,"It was hard to decipher Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s strategy against defending Asian champions Qatar at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. It was understandable that they wanted to defend against a team ranked 61st in the world, 41 places higher than them.
But in a vital FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier, India coach Igor Stimac decided to bench goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, undoubtedly the best player the last two times India faced the 2022 World Cup hosts. Not just that, the Croatian made four changes among the outfield players from the team that stunned Kuwait 1-0 in the opening game of the campaign.
The result of those changes was that India lacked coordination, especially when defending. And they were made to pay the price by their much taller, stronger, and in-sync opponents. The final scoreline read 0-3 but Stimac would know that the score couldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been much more humiliating had Qatar converted even half of the chances they created.

This was morwas also their toughest preparatory game ahead of the AFC Asian Cup in January, where similar or tougher tests await them. It was a chance for Stimac to show that India has attacking flair and a solid defence. But with Amrinder Singh replacing Gurpreet, the defence led by Sandesh Jhingan looked shaky from the start. Amrinder looked overawed by the occasion and responsibility. He had a nightmarish game with the ball at his feet, giving it away three times in the first half itself.
Qatar were coming from a 8-1 thrashing over Afghanistan. Coached by Carlos Queiroz, who has managed the likes of Iran, Portugal and Real Madrid, they almost took the lead in the second minute when a misplaced pass from Amrinder allowed their star striker Almoez Ali to walk into the Indian box and square it to Akram Afif.
Just about four yards in front of goal, Afif fluffed his chance to send it wide much to the relief of the packed Kalinga Stadium, which had former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in attendance.
**EDS: IMAGE VIA @IndianFootball** Bhubaneswar: Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Sunil Chhetri during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers match against Qatar, at Kalinga Stadium, in Bhubaneswar, Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023.

(PTI Photo)(PTI11_21_2023_000301B)
It didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t take long for Qatar to redeem themselves, courtesy of some chaotic defending by India. Just two minutes later, India managed to head Afifï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s corner out of the box, only for a Qatari player to send it back in. The ball pinballed in the Indian box and Udanta Singhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s failed clearance was met by the quick Mostafa Meshaal, who sent into the bottom corner.

An early goal seemed to ease the pressure of the away match and Qatar kept displaying t.
Changes donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t work
In the defensive set-up, Stimac brought in Anirudh Thapa for Sahal Abdul Samad, and at left-back, he replaced Ashish Mishra with Subhasish Bose. Benching the in-form Mahesh Singh and starting with Udanta Singh was also a risk that didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t pay off as India didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t look threatening on counters.
It was only after the half-hour mark that India started showing glimpses of what they are capable of. Probably their best move of the match came in the 35th minute when Thapa and Udanta played a series of one-twos to enter the Qatar box before Thapa pulled it back for Apuia Ralte waiting at the top of the area. The Mumbai City FC playmaker, who was easily Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s best player in the match, skied his shot into the stands.

However, that attack gave India belief that they too could penetrate the Qatar defence, which leaked four goals against Iran in their last friendly.
Thapa had Indiaï¿½ rob a Qatari defender and play the ball to Thapa.
With just the goalkeeper to beat, Thapa tried to be cheeky and poke the ball from the edge of the box, but it was well wide of the target.
Qatar doubled their lead in the first minute of the second half, as Almoez got on the scoresheet. Boualem Khouki sold Lallianzuala Chhangte a dummy and floated a lovely ball out to Afif waiting in the box. Afif smashed it at goal and Amrinder could only palm it under his body but Almoez, Qatarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s record goalscorer who scored four against Afghanistan, slid in to take his tally to 80 for his country.
Stimac made two changes early in the second half, bringing in Mahesh in place of Udanta at the start and getting Sahal in place of Thapa a little later. It was then that India started combining well and looked threatening. Sahal had a good chance in the 65th minute, finding himself in acres of space inside the box after a brilliant through ball by Suresh Singh, but he dragged his left-footed shot wide, pr much time he actually had.
Qatar put the game to bed in the 85th minute with substitute Yusuf Abdurisag scoring with the simplest of headers at the near post, and just like that, Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s
15-game unbeaten run at home was broken.

While they were certainly outplayed, they did show that it was possible to create chances against Asiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s best. They, however, need to find a striker capable of making a nuisance of himself against tough defences, for as it stands, Stimacï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s men are yet to register ",Sports

ýýýSometimes itýýýs nice to see ball dominate batýýý: Mitchell Starc after Australia beat South Africa at Eden Gardens,"Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood were the wreckers in chief for Australia after the Kangaroos bowled excellently in overcast conditions and reduced South Africa to 24/4 after Protea captain Bavuma won the toss and elected to bat.
However, David Millerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s rescue act took the South Africans to a respectable score of 212 but it was not enough as Pat Cummins made sure his team didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t let the opportunity slip away in a low-scoring run-chase against South Africa in the semifinals on Thursday.
The captain had to bail out his team with the bat as he and Mitchell Starc got the Aussies home by three wickets in pursuit of a 213-run target.

After the match, the Aussie seamer spoke at length about the low-scoring thriller and the pitch at Eden Gardens.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I think it was a tricky wicket throughout and I guess different phases of pressure for both teams throughout the game. So, yeah, I was pretty calm. I think Pat was pretty calm as wsqueeze past and make to a final,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Starc said while speaking at the post-match press conference.
However, Starc was a bit surprised at the nature of the surface and said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yeah, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m certainly not going to say Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m one to read pitches and know what they do. I mean, training here the last few days, the practice wicket certainly turned a lot. From all reports, I think the wicket we played on has been used a few times so no surprise that it did turn. It is probably a little surprising that it did seam around a little bit whilst I said before it was pretty inconsistent pace wise, I think average first inning scores here have been sort of around 300 mark or a little bit higher. So yeah, a little bit surprising but you know sometimes itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s nice to see ball dominate bat.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
On a personal front with the ball, Starc, who picked 3/34, expressed happiness with his spell ar power play was probably what got us on our way. And there were other key moments through the day with bat and ball, but to start the game like that with Joshie [Hazelwood] and I, power play wickets have probably been not our strong suit through the tournament so itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s nice to have a power play of what two for 18 or something like that so the way Josh bowled throughout to finish two for 12 was incredible, and then Trav with bat and ball.

"Hardik Pandya, injured during World Cup, set to miss series against Australia, South Africa","All rounder Hardik Pandya will be out for at least another two months because of the ankle injury sustained when he tried to stop a ball off his own bowling in the World Cup league game against Bangladesh.
The Indian Express understands that Pandya will miss the upcoming T20I series at home against Australia and is also likely to miss three T20Is and three ODIs in South Africa.
The Baroda all-rounder lost his balance while trying to stop a shot from Bangladesh opener Liton Das and dragged his right boot while landing on the pitch. He got up and looked in discomfort as he stood on his haunches. Pandya was later rushed to the National Cricket Academy for rehabilitation and then ruled out from the ongoing World Cup.

The medical team is yet to take a call if Pandya needs a surgery.

The support staff didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want him to put too much pressure on hhat Pandya didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t face any problem in the first three balls he bowled. He decided to increase the intensity of his bowling for the next delivery. It was during the fourth ball that he felt a bit of pain in his leg.

Pandya informed the support staff about the pain he felt on his right ankle. The NCA medical team decided to get another round of scans done.

Pandya had penned down a heartfelt message on the X: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Tough to digest the fact that I will miss out on the remaining part of the World Cup. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be with the team, in spirit, cheering them on every ball of every game. Thanks for all the wishes, the love, and the support has been incredible.

ICC pitch consultant raises concerns about switching of pitch that might favour India if they reach ODI World Cup final,"ICC pitch consultant Andy Atkinson has raised questions whether the pitch for the final of the ICC World Cup to be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on November 19 will be prepared ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½without favouritismï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

The Daily Mail reported that Atkinson had flown to Ahmedabad last Friday to check on preparations for the final after being unsatisfied with the pitch changes being made to reportedly favour India, the home team.

The Indian Express reported on Tuesday that the Indian team management asked BCCI curators to shave off most of the grass on the Wankhede Stadium playing surface for their semifinal clash against New Zealand.

The management wanted a slow surface that will assist Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s world-class spinners.

India has performed well on slow tracks at home over the past few years. Before the World Cup, the team management had requested for their matches to be held on slow pitches.

Pitches at ICC events are he home board which of the numbered strips on the square will be used for each game.

The Daily Mail report however says that the Ahmedebad Stadium has played three of the four group games on different surfaces from those on the schedule. And Atkinson fears the same could happen if India reach the final on Sunday.

Atkinsonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s recommendation was that the final should be played on pitch No 5, which has been used only once, though he learned last week that pitch No 6 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which has been used twice ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ could get the nod to bring Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s spinners into play.

In his email, Atkinson warns: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As a result of these actions, one must speculate if this will be the first ever ICC CWC (cricket World Cup) final to have a pitch which has been specifically chosen and prepared to their stipulation at the request of the team management and/or the hierarchy of the home nation board.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ al manner, and unquestionably because it is the usual pitch for the occasion?ï¿½",Sports

40-over games in ODI

As the World Cup has chugged along, there has been plenty of debate about the future of the 50-over format. The former India coach weighed in, suggesting that the format should be reduced to 40 overs. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think changes have to be made. When we won the World Cup in 83 it was a 60-over game it changed to 50 overs. You have to evolve with time, you have to see the attention span of the spectator. It is diminishing. I think the way forward would be a 40-over game.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

"Rajasthan polls: After jugglery to accommodate Diya Kumari, BJPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s sa","In Chittorgarhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Gandhi Nagar square, Gopal Purabia is having a tough time convincing his customers to vote for the BJP. Purabia who runs the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Namo tea stallï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at the square is a BJP worker and a Narendra Modi fan. So are his customers. But they are rooting for rebel candidate and sitting MLA Chandrabhan Singh Akya who has been overlooked as the party tried to make accommodations after fielding Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari from a seat in Jaipur.
As the conversation at the tea stall illustrates, this has put Chittorgarh, one of the BJPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s safe seats, in jeopardy. Purabia keeps telling his customers to vote based on ideology but not just them, even his brother refuses to listen to him. Ratanlal Kumawat, another committed BJP worker from the nearby village of Ghatiawali, expresses his frustration. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½No one is thinking about the country ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ people are getting swayed bys three-term MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi, the son-in-law of former Vice-President, and ex-Rajasthan CM, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in Chittorgarh, which comes under the Lok Sabha constituency of state BJP president C P Joshi. After being denied his constituency in the first list, Rajvi had hit out at the party, calling the decision ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½shockingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and saying it was a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½way to defame and hurt the legacyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of his father-in-law.

Rajvi is no stranger to Chittorgarh though. He won the elections from there in 1993 and 2003 before being moved to Jaipur in 2008. But that has not stopped Akya, who has won from Chittorgarh the last two terms, from making a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½local vs outsiderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ pitch during campaigning. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½by past 10 years,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he tells The Indian Express.
The rebel candidate has launched a whirlwind campaign. His supporters, many of them former BJP workers, go around town on jeeps, waving pressure cookers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ his poll symbol ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and shouting, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Phul, haath rehne do, cooker ki seeti bajne do (Donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t go for the lotus or the hand, let the cookerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s whistle make noise)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. At his public meetings, Akya is weighed in a balance against an equivalent amount of sweets and fruits, which are then distributed among people. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are the real BJP,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ claims his campaign manager Anil Inani.
Rajvi, however, says the rebel candidate is not a factor and people will vote for the party and him. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Akya will come third,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he claims.

Facing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½anti-incumbencyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, the Congress MLAs are banking on Gehlotï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s welfare measures ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and his face ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ to help them sail through, even as the CM has appealed to voters to see these elections as if he is contesting it on all 200 seats himself.
About 30 hours before the curtains come down on campaigning in the state and just before setting out to give one final push through another round of his whirlwind tours, Gehlot sits down at his residence in Jaipur for an interview with The Indian Express. Excerpts:

BJP has no CM face this time around. Do you think it is benefiting the Congress?
It naturally helps. It is a Vidhan Sabha election, but you (BJP) are contesting it in Lok Sabha style. Central leaders are coming, there is PM Modi, Amit Shah ji, five Chief Ministers have come, 5-7 Union Ministers. Toh poora dhawa bol rakha hai Rajasthan pe (They have launched a full-scale offensive in Rajasthan) as they could not topple our government. So when they could not topple the government here while managing to topple governments in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and played foul in Goa and Manipur, toh sarkaar nahi girane ka dard chhipa hua hai inke dil ke andar (so the pain of not being able to topple the government is in their hearts) which keeps coming out time and again. Woh is liye dhawa bolte hain (Hence theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve launched an offensive) on me, my family, PCC president and his family, and the government.

In the last six months there have been raids on 51 locations by CBI, Income Tax, ED. Ask them, have you been able to pinpoint any politician or a bureaucrat (in connection with any case)?
You had said that the Congress will announce candidates two months in advance but there was a delay, and even then most sitting MLAs were repeated despite anti-incumbency. Why?
Option nahi hota (there is no option). First, the work is done for five years through MLAs, including in Panchayati Raj and Nagar Palika. And when the (local party) unit is set up, it is done through them. When everything is done through them, so naturally by the time elections come, woh he sab kuch hota hai wahan par (MLA becomes everything there). Although, this shouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be the case. Ideally, (party) organisation should do organisation work and MLA should do MLA work. But unfortunatelMLA increases in every political party. This time (in next government) we will try that MLA does MLA work and organisation does organisation work, this will be my thinking.
Apparently, there is unity between you and Sachin Pilot, but on the ground there still seems to be a lot of disagreement between your supporters.
I canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t say what kind of situation is in a particular area. But by and large we are trying to go into the campaign united.
Who will be the CM if the Congress returns to power?
I have said it many times that we have had a good tradition in the party ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ we pass a single line proposal. And high command also considers what the MLAs feel, what the common man thinks, and decides.

Who is Sourav Ganguly batting for now? Kolkata back to an old game,"AS BATSMAN, skipper, BCCI president or commentator, Sourav Ganguly thrived on unfriendly pitches. The presumed Prince of Kolkataï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s presumptive political project, however, is taking longer to find its feet ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ with the latest development putting him in Team Trinamool Congress.
On Tuesday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee named Ganguly as the stateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Brand Ambassador, replacing megastar Shah Rukh Khan. The announcement, at the TMC governmentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Global Business Summit gala, came two months after Ganguly accompanied the CM on a rare foreign visit by her, as a precursor to the summit and to draw investment to Bengal.
And it came just over a year after a reluctant Ganguly was replaced as BCCI president with Roger Binny, in an organisation where the shots are seen as called by Secretary Jay Shah, the son of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Go further back, to before the 2021 Assembly polls, and ýs high-decibel campaign had talked up the partyýýýs chances in the elections, though these were swept by the TMC eventually.
The rumours of Gangulyýýýs proximity to the BJP top brass at the time had grown after photographs emerged of him hosting Shah along with senior state BJP leaders Suvendu Adhikari and Sukanta Majumder for a meal at his home.

Days later though, Ganguly was by the side of Mamata at the State Secretariat. In September 2022, he shared the stage with her at a thanksgiving ceremony after Bengal got the UNESCO heritage tag for Durga Puja.
But it was the end of Gangulyýýýs BCCI tenure in October 2022 that was the firmest hint that the bonhomie between the cricketer and BJP may have ended.

After his appointment as Bengal brand ambassador Tuesday, BJP leaders openly speculated that Mamata had made her move for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls by co-opting arguably Bengalýýýs biggest sporting star.
Addressing Ganguly, who was seated on the dais, the CM said at the business summit: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He is a very popular figure and comes from a younger generation. I want to inform him that he is now the brand ambassador of Bengal. I will request him to accept thisï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ You canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t say no.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
The former India cricket captain had earlier been as full of praise for the CM in his speech at the programme. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I say this genuinely, whenever I send her (Mamata) an SMS, I get a response within a minute. Rarely is there a delay. Whenever she watches me on television, she sends an SMS, asking how I am and whether I have eaten.

Before the 2021 Assembly polls, he was said to have declined a BJP proposal for direct entry into politics.

"As Telangana sentiment wanes, other issues bubble up, as do Congress hopes","The battle for Telangana is winding down to a contest of promises, with just about a week left for polling now. While the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR is showcasing the state governmentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s welfare schemes, the Congress is projecting a slew of similar schemes it is pledging if voted to power.
Across large swathes of the erstwhile undivided districts of Nalgonda and Mahbubnagar, the Congress appears to have a fresh energy in its ranks.
In the Assembly elections held in 2014 to a united Andhra Pradesh (Telangana was carved out soon after), the then incumbent Congress, despite a pro-BRS (BRS was formerly called Telangana Rashtra Samithi) wave, had got 25.20% of the votes, against the BRSï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 34% in the Telangana area.

The rise in BRS votes was attributed to the pro-Telangana state sentiment, as the party was widely perceived to be one of its key architects.
But that sentiment seems to have waned now. Very few people talk about the sacrifices that people, especially youth, made for the cause of Telangana statehood. Their concerns have instead shifted to issues like welfare schemes, government jobs, development, and civic infrastructure ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and, evidently, the Congress.
Whether this perceived surge in peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s interest in the Congress will translate into votes come November 30 remains to be seen. And Telangana Congress chief A Revanth Reddy, who is spearheading the partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s campaign, is mindful of this, cautioning his party candidates not to get carried away by ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hypeï¿½antage of the mood,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he told them at Nagarkurnool Tuesday.

In Nalgonda district, the Congress hopes rest on the Komatireddy brothers, Venkat Reddy and Raj Gopal, with the party celebrating his return from the BJP. The two brothers, together with their immense financial muscle, have thrown in their weight behind all the party candidates in this region.
In the 2014 polls, in the undivided Nalgonda district with 12 Assembly seats, the BRS had won 6 seats as compared to the Congressï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 5. In the 2018 polls, the BRS won 9 seats as against the Congressï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 3, which included the Nakrekal, Huzurnagar, and Munugode seats. The Congress later lost the Huzurnagar and Munugode seats to the BRS in the bypolls.

At Cheruvugattu in the area, Pravin Chari, a diploma civil engineer, who calls himself a BRS supporter, is also sceptical of the ruling partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s chances. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Youth are a bit disappointed over lack of government jobs. I think that factor and the feeling that has settled among people that only pro-BRS beneficiaries have taken advantage, will result in tough contests all over Nalgonda,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he says.
At Deverkonda, former Communist Sarpanch M Ramesh Reddy says that the Komatireddy brothers are ensuring a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½tough fightï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ between the BRS and Congress. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If the BRS has to win, all the beneficiaries have to vote for it,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he says.

In 2018, the BRS made a clean sweep in the region, bagging 13 seats while the Congress could get just 1 seat.
Congress stalwart Revanth Reddy is now contesting from the Kodangal seat here, while Jupally Krishna Rao, who quit the BRS to join the Congress, is another prominent contender from the district.

Soon after, three Dalit Karnataka ministers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Home Minister G Parameshwara, Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa and Food and Civil Supplies Minister K H Muniyappa ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ along with seven-time Congress Lok Sabha MP K H Muniyappa, requested Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to accept the report.
In fact, Muniyappa, who belongs to the Madiga community ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ considered the most deprived among Dalits ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ has given a call to all Madigas to stage statewide protests demanding the implementation of the report. Two weeks ago, he had asked the community to stick to their demand for the implementation of the report in the state.
The Madigas are the quotas, and consider the Sadashiva report to be key to the delivery of social justice, because it studied the socio-economic conditions of Dalits as sub groups.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½In our SC/ST convention before the state polls, we adopted a declaration, one of whose points was the promise to table the Sadashiva Commission report in the first Assembly session itself,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Home Minister G Parameshwara, who belongs to a smaller but better-off sub-group of Dalits called Holeyas.
Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa, who is also a Holeya, however, believes the Sadashiva report needs to be considered, but only within the framework of the Constitution, and through consultations with the Law Department.
Law department officials, however, are of the view that the implementation of the report is now the prerogative of the Centre, since the previous outgoing BJP government had partially accepted it and recommended internal quotas through a Cabinet sub-committee that sSadashiva Commission report was accepted by the previous BJP government and placed before a Cabinet sub-committee headed by the then law minister. After the sub-committee modified the recommendations, they were accepted by the government,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said sources in the state law department.
The Sadashiva Commission findings
Among the essential findings of the Sadashiva Commission, which were publicised through a press release in 2012, is that Madigas (SC Left), who are considered untouchable in the caste hierarchy, are more socially backward than the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½SC Rightï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ groups like Holeyas, who are considered more acceptable in society.
The commission also found that most of the existing 15% quota for 101 Dalit sub-groups was being cornered by the SC Right groups like Holeyas and new SC groups like the Bhovis and the Lambanis, while the most backward Madigas continued to be deprived.
The report also indicated that while Holeyas and Madigas made up neaere about 2% higher than that of the Holeyas.
The BJP had promised to implement internal reservations before the 2018 Assembly polls. In power, however, the BJP government then led by CM Basavaraj Bommai rejected the Justice Sadashiva Commission report, but said it could implement some recommendations made by the Cabinet sub-committee set up to study the report. The government ended up allotting 6% quotas to the SC Left (including Madigas, as suggested by the report), 5.5% to the SC Right (Holeyas), 4.5% to the touchables (Bhovis and Lambanis), and 1% to other Dalits.

Before accepting the recommendations of the sub-committee, the Bommai government increased the overall quota for SCs in the state from 15% to 17%. Since this raised the combined SC-ST quota by 6% ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ taking total reservations in the state to 56% (OBCs 32%, SCs 17%, STs 7%), ie., above the 50% ceiling fixed by the SC in the 1992 Indira Sawhney judgment ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the Bommai government asked tnth Schedule of the Constitution, to prevent these from being overturned by courts.
The poll boomerang
Eventually, the Karnataka BJPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s move to hike the reservation quota of SCs and STs before the Assembly elections in May had not paid off. While the party failed to secure a single ST-reserved seat ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it had won seven last time ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ its tally of SC-reserved seats dropped from 16 in 2018 to 12.

"Decoding Politics: Why is BJP raising two ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½commentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½","Poll-bound Rajasthanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s political discourse seems to be revolving around two key issues. Firstly, a comment by state Cabinet minister and Ashok Gehlot loyalist Shanti Dhariwal, which allegedly insulted the women of the state.
Another issue that has grabbed the limelight is an alleged remark by Chief Minister Gehlotï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s son Vaibhav, that the Congress government led by his father will not come back to power.
So, how have the two issues become a frequent feature of the political discourse in Rajasthan?
Dhariwalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s statement and the subsequent row

On March 9 last year, a day after International Womenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Day, Dhariwal during an address in the Assembly said the high number of rapes in Rajasthan were due to it ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½being a menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s stateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.
Replying during a debate on grants to the p s**** (Why we are number one in rapes, there is a fault somewhere).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
As a few MLAs behind him began speaking, Dhariwal turned around and said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rajasthan toh mardon ka pradesh raha hai. Ab uska kya kare? (Rajasthan has been a state of men. What can be done?)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The MLAs then burst into laughter.
However, no protests were held in the Assembly over the remarks as the Opposition BJP had staged a walkout before the ministerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s address. However, later in the day, BJP state president Satish Poonia slammed Dhariwalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s comments and termed his ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½shameless confession of the state being number one in rapesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ an insult to the women.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The remarks have also lowered the dignity of men. If the Congress has any morality left, such a minister should be sacked,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he had said.

The ministerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s candidature for the polls hung in the balance with the Congress high command reportedly against it for his role in organising a separate meeting of MLAs loyal to Gehlot while skipping an official Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting last year. Eventually, he was fielded by the party from Kota North, which he represents in the current Assembly.
The BJP has now dug up the year-old issue to slam the Congress. At a rally in Bharatpur last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Dhariwal without naming him.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Congress has rewarded this minister with a ticket instead of punishing him. Even people in Delhi (Congress high command) agreed to give him a ticket. This raises a question of what ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½second red diaryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is in the possession of jaadugarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s (Gehlot) favouritDelhi. After the BJP forms the government here, I promise to unravel that secret too,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Modi had said.
This brings us to the question of what the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½first red diaryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is.
The first red diary and Vaibhavï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s statement
The ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½red diaryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ first hogged the limelight in July after former minister of state Rajendra Singh Gudha claimed he was sent by the CM to retrieve the diary from the house of Gehlotï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s close aide Dharmendra Rathore, whose house was being raided by central agencies amid a political crisis in 2020.

Gudhaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s claims came after he was sacked as minister by Gehlot, hours after he had slammed the state government in the House over the rise in crimes against women. The former MoS had urged his government to introspect on this, rather than speak on the violence in Manipur.
Since his unceremonious  had he not retrieved the diary.

Gudha has now joined the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde) and will be in the fray from Udaipurwati constituency, which he won in 2018 as a BSP candidate.
Last week too, the Udaipurwati MLA raked up the issue when he showed some pages of the purported diary to the media. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Vaibhav Gehlot says this government will not come back to power. I can give it in writing that my father cannot come back to power. Rajendra Gudha is not saying this. This is being said by Vaibhav Gehlot, the chief ministerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s son,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the Udaipurwati MLA said while flaunting pages of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½red diaryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, though there is no confirmation of Vaibhav having said this.

Now, the BJP is cashing in.
In 2018, the Gujjar community had rallied behind Pilot, electing 8 Gujjar MLAs from the Congress and none from the BJP. The BJP and Congress are matched in tickets to Gujjar candidates this time ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 10 and 11, respectively ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and the BJP is banking on the community favouring it, especially in eastern Rajasthan, where Pilotï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s influence goes well beyond the Gujjar community.
The BJP has been working on the plan for long. This January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a programme to commemorate the 1,111th ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Avataran Mahotsavï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of Gujjar deity Devnarayan in Bhilwara.

This August, during a visit to Tonk, Pilot was accosted by Mohsin Rasheed, the Rajasthan coordinator of the Congress minority cell, who asked why he hadnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t spoken up on the Nasir-Junaid case, referring to the killing of two Muion being that they were not innocent.

After Muslims, the biggest chunk of voters in Tonk are SCs, followed by Gujjars, and then Jats, STs and upper castes. While Pilotï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s candidature makes it a safe seat for the Congress now, it has voted almost equally for the party and BJP since the BJP was formed in 1980 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ with the BJP winning in 1980, 1990, 1993, 2003 and 2013; and the Congress in 1985, 1998, 2008 and 2018.
Last time, Pilot won by over 54,000 votes against the BJPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Yunus Khan, an influential leader displaced from his traditional bastion.
While Pilot is expected to win again, if not as comfortably, even staunch Gujjar supporters believe the government may be changing in Jaipur.

So, if it is seen tilting, one way or the other, by even a very small degree, it can have great consequences for democracy,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he told The Indian Express days after he retired as Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court.
After an 11-month stint as Chief Justice of Madras High Court, Justice Banerjee was transferred as Chief Justice of the Meard (in Madras HC) for a while and I felt there were some aberrations which is why those observations were made. Crowding in rallies and not following Covid protocol was certainly a concern and when the elections in West Bengal was held an eight phases, why was it held in a single phase in Tamil Nadu? You have to look at it in that context and not pick just two sentences,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Justice Banerjee said.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Also, one cannot say that the court canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t make any observations. Lawyers cannot be expected to argue with a wall. They have to get indications from the bench so they can tailor their case accordingly,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.
The EC had moved the Supreme Court against these observations, terming them ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½uncalled for, blatantly disparaging and derogatory.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
While the SC refused to expunge the observation or bar the media from reporting it, Justice Banerjeeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Mew the reasons behind his unusual transfer, Justice Banerjee said that he is not concerned with the reason.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I am sure there were cogent reasons for my transfer but I am not aware of it. I received an email (from then CJI NV Ramanaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s office) and I said yes. Once you become a judge, you cannot have any ambitions of holding a particular office. So there was no question of me not consenting to the transfer,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.
A statement published by the Collegium on November 9, 2021 said that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the Supreme Court collegium in its meeting held on 16th September, 2021, has recommended the transfer of Mr Justice, Sanjiv, Banerji, Chief Justice, Madras High Court to Meghalaya High Court.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

While the statement cited no reason, Justice Banerjee said that the email only indicated that the transfer would be in the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½interest of better administration of justice.ï¿½M my 11 months in Madras, I had very rewarding judicial work. But in Meghalaya, there wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t a lot of judicial work but we focused on infrastructure building.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
On his stint in Madras, Justice Banerjee said that he was far from wanting to maintain the status quo and actively handled things in Madras High Court.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½While the idea is that a Chief Justice who comes from outside takes a dispassionate view when it comes to appointments or other aspects, there is a flip side that they could end up being status quo-ists without wanting to ruffle too many feathers. By and large, the office of Chief Justice is considered a stepping stone for Supreme Court judgeship. It is to be somewhere but look elsewhere and not take steps to actively address the uncle judge syndrome when it comes to appointments,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.
As a High Court judge for nearly two decades, he said, corruption in the higher judiciary worries him.
Advertiseicult to gather evidence. These activities are not done in broad daylight but it is possible to collect some evidence of corruption. However, impeachment is a political solution. A compromised judge is convenient for all political parties. This is an aspect which erodes faith in the system and needs to be tackled,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",Political

"Alliance talks on backburner, BJP banks on Central schemes as Akalis aim for youth in Punjab","SEASONED politicians from the BJP and Akali Dal want the two long-time friends to come together again. But, for now, this seems in suspended animation.
Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, while the SAD is trying to bank on youth to revive its political fortunes, the BJP is counting on Central schemes to strike a chord in the rural belt, a segment the saffron party had once left for its former ally to take care of.
On November 14, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal launched a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Global Youth Membership Driveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ under the aegis of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Punjab di shaan, saade naujawan (Our youth the pride of Punjab)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. As part of the drive, the SAD aims to give 50% party posts to youth aged 35 or below at the district level, and 40 years or below at the state level, apart from giving them ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½appropriateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ electoral representation.

Senior SAD leader and former Nakodar MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s focus is now on the next generation. They exercise a huge voice in the decision-making within their respective families at the time of voting. The political spectrum is moved by the youth. So, for any party to remain relevant, focus on the youth is of utmost importance. Hence, the Akali move.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Jhinjer said the youth who are enrolling would go on to be ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½future MPs, MLAs and members of the SGPC and zila parishads. At least 60% of the electors are youth, and they are the futunts, with 2,000 being the minimum qualifying number in a district.

The BJP, on the other hand, is focusing on beneficiaries of schemes sponsored by the Centre. Confined mostly to urban areas when it was an ally of the SAD, the Punjab BJP is now focusing heavily on rural areas, including via Shakti Kendras, to create a grassroots party cadre. To begin with, the party plans to appoint an activist each to head booths, and create a team of 15-20 volunteers at the village level.

Excerpts:

Joshi has been in politics for a long time, but over the years, he has earned a reputation which I think will work to my advantage. Also, in the same Nathdwara constituency, we have Shrinathji and Haldighati (the historical battlefield where Maharana Pratap fought Mughal emperor Akbar in 1576).

* So you think your lineage is an advantage?

There is a strong bond (between the royal family and the people). This sentiment brings about a feeling of trust, which is often lacking in politics. So yesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

* It is believed the BJP has fielded you just keeping your lineage in mind and not performance.

The question implies that lineage does not guarantee a good performance. I strongly disagree with this. I understand that e.

* You have been attacking Joshi. What is your promise for the Nathdwara electorate?

I am not making any personal comments against the Congress candidate. It is the general impression about the Congress here. I bring to the table what the BJP has achieved and what it hopes to in the future. Some of the key issues where I will put in my sincere efforts are increasing payments to farmers and to curb the rising price of petrol, which is the most expensive in the state.

* The Congress is banking on its welfare policies to win. How do you plan to counter it?

I disagree that the Congress has rolled out welfare policies. For four-and-a-half years, they have been squabbling over who is going to be chief minister. Announcements made over the past few months have been done keeping the upcoming elections in mind. Administratively, I do not think any of these decisions were wise. On the one hand, they are decreasing the price of LPG cylinders, but are hiking petrol prices. This is like taking money from the right pocket and keeping it in the left.

* The BJPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s constant reference to the killing of Kanhaiya Lal, which occurred in your city, is seen as a bid to polarise voters.

I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want to comment on whether the incident is being used to polarise voters on communal lines. When we contest elections, we fight for all communities. If there has been any polarisation, it may be an organic reaction to the incident and not the result of someoneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s deliberate attempt. Also, there is no accountability regarding crimes against women in the state. The government relief in the Kanhaiya Lal case came very late and was not equal to what was given in Jaipur (in case of another killing). I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t think things are being handled in a fair manner.

It is widely believed that Joshiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s aspirations of becoming CM vanished with the defeat.

Caste conundrum

A key factor that is likely to influence the electoral outcome in Nathdwara is the caste composition of the electorate. Rajputs alone make up 30% of the voters while Brahmins are 15%. The BJP, by fielding the Mewar royal, is hoping that the Rajput pride translates into votes in its favour.

The preference of candidates based on caste seems to be evident on the ground too. While conceding that Joshi, a Brahmin, has done a lot of work in the constituency, Mahipal Singh, a Rajput, throws his weight behind Vishwaraj Singh.

Replying to the allegations of Jethmalani, Sena UBT MP Anil Desai said that the whip is issued by a party for its legislators and questioned how can a lawyer raise a question on its validity or call it bogus.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The whip is genuine and the attempts made by their (Shinde led Senaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ) lawyer would not be succeeded to prove the whip a bogus one,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Desai said.
During the hearing on Wednesday, Jethmalani questioned Prabhu, about the details of whip which Prabhu claimed to have issued to Sena MLAs to attend the partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s meeting on June 21, 2022.
The cross examination over the whip issued to Sena MLAs holds a lot of significance since the Sena UBT has filed a disqualification petitions against the Sena rebel MLAs claiming that the MLAs d submission in last month, the Shinde-led Sena had claimed that they never received any whip as claimed by Sena UBT and hence there is no question of defying the whip and there is no question of disqualification.
During the hearing the Jethmalani questioned Prabhu about when and how the whip was issued to the MLAs and whether he has received copy of whip from the MLAs, in order to prove that the whip was forged and was not even issued.
While replying to the questions, an official said, Prabhu replied saying that whip was signed and issued him on June 20, 2022. However, it was in the intervening night of June 20 and 21 and hence it was dated June 21 and issued physically to those Sena MLAs who were present in the office and at MLA guest house.

However, those MLAs who were missing or untraceable were sent the whip through WhatsApp, the official quoted Prabhu as saying.
On Tuesday, Sena lawyer had begin cross examination of Prabhu and started recording his statement.
During the cross examination on Tuesday, Prabhu asserted that the Sena MLAs who went to Surat and then Guwahati in June 2022 along with Shinde were under pressure by the BJP and there was a discussion that the MLAs were abducted.
The cross examination will continue for the next couple of days.
Meanwhile Speaker Rahul Narwekar who is holding the hearing, expressed his displeasure over the slow proceeding.

Vir Das on International Emmy win for Best Comedy: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I hope we,"Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s still ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½just a guy on a stoolï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for whom the audienceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s laughter will always be more precious than accolades, says Vir Das, the first Indian comic to win an International Emmy Award.
Das won the award for his Netflix stand-up special Vir Das: Landing in the best comedy category at a ceremony in New York on Monday night. He tied with the much acclaimed British series Derry Girls for the coveted prize.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The job is to take the beautiful chosen people of the world and humanise them a little bit by making an idiot out of myselfï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I hope we all just get sillier and continue to be fools,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the actor-comic, who returned home on Wednesday, told PTI in a virtual interview.

The future of the Indian comedy scene is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½tremendousï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, the 41-year-old said.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½isgnition laughter.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½In my speech, I made sure to thank the Indian people for their laughter. I said it was the soundtrack to my life,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.

Injecting a note of reality as he celebrates his first International Emmy trophy, Vir Das said it will get him ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½maybe 30 seconds extra applauseï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ when he walks out on the stage. After that, it will only be about the laughs.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I will have to make them (the audience) laugh. At the end of the day, they will be like, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have paid for this, so make us laugh.'ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Das, who has often courted trouble over his quirky, observational performances and social media posts, is already readying for shows in Chandigarh and Bengaluru.

He was one of the three Indians to be nominated at the 51st International Emmy Awards along with Shefali Shah for Delhi Crime season two (Netflix) and J Instagram A post shared by Vir Das (@virdas)
The comic said there was ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a bit of suspenseï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at the awards gala when the winner for best comedy category was going to be announced because two envelopes made an appearance on the stage all of a sudden.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I tied with ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Derry Girlsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, one of the best shows in the world,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he added.
That they were surprised to hear their name called out is generally a cliched response but the comedian said he only went to the International Emmy Awards with the intent to root for Shefali Shah, who was vying for a win in the best performance by an actress category. She was bested by Karla Souza of La Caida, a Mexican show.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I really considered my job to be there to root for Shefali. She is a once-in-a-generation talentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I was just kind of focusing my energy on her. I was genuinely surpix show, itself is an achievement. So, when they said (the winner is) Vir Das: Landing, I was very, very surprised,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.

Vir Das kind of fumbled his way up to the stage, but he got his thank yous right which was very important.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I said many things. The second I got off the stage, I panicked (wondering) did I thank everyone? I hope I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t mess it up.

Vir Das: Landing is Dasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ fourth special with Netflix. This was his second nod at the International Emmys; first one, also with the streamer, was for Vir Das: For India in 2021.
Through Vir Das: Landing, the aim was to tell the world what his ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½idea of homeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is, the comic said.

He was born in Dehradun and spent the first 14 years of his lifeýýý.
ýýýI get to travel the world. Itýýýs a tremendous privilege. What that comes with is I spend eight months a year missing home sometimes during a world tour. The germ of the show is from there. I miss home and a lot of times if Iýýým in New York or London, there are 3,000 people in the room, out of which 1,500 are Indians who havenýýýt been in a room with so many Indians in a really long time. You are their catch-up, their update with home. Thatýýýs what the central feeling of the show was. I donýýýt think there could be a better stage for the show to get some love than an international stage,ýýý he said.
His win comes almost a month after the sudden demise of popular American actor and comedian Matthew Perry. The late actor is best known for the popular 1990s sitcom Friends, in which he played the iconic role of socially awkward but amiable Chandler Bing who uses sarcasm to get by in life.
Das, who had shared a heartfelt tribute for Perry on social media after his passing, said the Friends star essayed his part like a lovable fool.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The jesterï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s job, the jokerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s job, the foolï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s job is to make fun of people to make them seem beautiful. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s what Matthew Perry did very well in a scene. He made the other person look good by being how silly he could be.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Vir Das, also known for films such as Go Goa Gone, Delhi Belly, and Love Aaj Kal, has several acting projects lined up for 2024.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I just wrapped up a show which should be out soonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I co-directed a feature that goes on floor in February that Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll star in.
