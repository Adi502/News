"Team India’s backroom staff includes a former maths teacher, a mountaineer, a former bus driver, an IT engineer, and a civic police volunteer","Paras Mhambrey

Bowling coach

A modern-day coach

The 51-year-old has been head coach Rahul Dravid’s trusted lieutenant since their India U-19 and India A team days. Having served as the head coach of Maharashtra, Bengal and Vidarbha he has also been with the National Cricket Academy. The pace pack loves the freedom he gives. Was originally brought into the fold to help with the transition phase the attack was going through in Tests and T20Is.

Having implemented the workload management policy at the NCA, Dravid has been using this expertise in the lead-up to the World Cup. With a young crop of pacers – who he is familiar with thanks to his stint with U-19 and India A – Mhambrey is also putting the transition plan in place in red-ball cricket and T20Is. He doesn’t believe in spending too much time in team meetings, and instead likes to slip in all the data and analytics through the dashboard, which is on every player’s phone. In that sense, he is every bit a modern-day coach, who prefers to mix data with coaching manuals. Like his predecessor Bharat Arun, he has carried forward the five-bowlers theory at all costs.

In the lead-up to the World Cup with star pacer Jasprit Bumrah injured, instead of grooming the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Shivam Mavi, Avesh Khan, it was Mhambrey who advocated Mohammed Shami’s inclusion, despite the seamer having played very few ODIs in the recent past.

Vikram Rathour

Batting coach

The schedule-maker

The only coaching staff to be associated with this team since Ravi Shastri & his men left the space. From the time he came on board after the previous World Cup, he has been harping about the need to be a lot more aggressive with the bat. And it is only at this World Cup that the world got to see the true potential and might of India’s line-up.

Not the most gifted batsman during his playing days, after hanging up his boots, Rathour spent a few years in England before returning to coach Punjab and Himachal on the domestic circuit. He was also a national selector when Virat Kohli was captain. The 54-year-old is at the forefront of India’s training sessions, where he usually makes the schedule. A firm believer in giving batsmen freedom to go for shots irrespective of the format, Rathour has publicly backed the likes of Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer when they have been dismissed going for the big shots in Tests.

Behind the scenes, he prefers to have one-on-one sessions with batsmen on almost a series-by-series basis. Not known to tinker much with their technique, but also the first to jump in and have a say at the nets if he sees something missing. To make it easier for the players, he instructs the team’s data analyst to video-record their net sessions and play it later on. He is known to seldom show his emotions and was even tipped to take a top role at the NCA.

T Dilip

Fielding coach

Former math teacher

One who got extremely popular during the World Cup for introducing the ‘best fielder’s medal’ in the Indian dressing room, Dilip doesn’t have any cricketing background. With just tennis-ball cricket behind him, coaching became his calling from a young age. First up, he worked in age-group academies in Hyderabad before he got a chance to work with Deccan Chargers in the IPL. At the now- defunct franchise, he would get a chance to be with renowned baseball coach Mike Young, who coached Australia in the past. And from there on, his graph kept moving upward.

With no playing experience, Dilip would then enrol for a coaching programme at the NCA, where he would work with former India fielding coach R Sridhar. This was a period when he used to take maths tuitions to fund his coaching education and once he cleared the exams, became a regular face at the NCA. During the off-season, Dilip was a regular presence at the NCA zonal and annual camps, during which time he caught Dravid’s eye. Though Dravid had mostly worked with Abhay Sharma as the fielding coach during his stints with five Under-19 and A teams, the former India captain handpicked Dilip for the national team. With the Indian team, apart from maintaining the fielding standards set by Sridhar, his biggest contribution is how he has turned KL Rahul into a thorough wicketkeeper. With unique coaching gear, he has been spending hours together to get Rahul’s positioning right.

Strength and conditioning

Soham Desai

An avid mountaineer

He started his foray in cricket with the Gujarat Ranji side between 2014-16. He spent a good part of 18 months working with a private fitness studio where he trained some popular personalities in Chennai under the guidance of Shankar Basu, the former S&C coach, who was instrumental in improving fitness standards. From there, as the NCA revamped its S&C programme, Desai was at the forefront of it, spending four years at the academy before being promoted as assistant at the Indian team during the Covid years. Once Nick Webb vacated the seat, Desai, who’s an avid mountaineer, became the lead S&C coach after the 2021 T20 World Cup.

S Rajnikanth

Rehab master

A very popular figure, he is the one players turned to when they are undergoing rehab. Even when he was not associated with the NCA, injured players like Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer have sought him out to regain full fitness. Having been part of Delhi Capitals and Gujarat Titans set- up in the past, Rajnikanth joined NCA recently, where he monitored the rehab programme of Bumrah, KL Rahul, Shreyas and Prasidh Krishna. Thanks to his relaxed training programme, he ensured everyone regained full fitness and with the World Cup in mind, the Indian team brought him on board to specially oversee these four players.

A left-arm pacer, who gave up professional cricket to pursue a degree in engineering. Soon after completing bachelor’s degree in Information and technology, during which time he captained his college team, Hari joined Sportsmechanics which has been associated with the Indian team since 2000. Part of the backroom staff, he spent several hours studying footage before being part of the Tamil Nadu Ranji team. His biggest breakthrough came when CKM Dhananjay stepped aside as the Indian team analyst post the 2019 World Cup, and Hari stepped into his shoes. One can always spot him sitting with his laptop next to India’s coaching staff. He is the team’s eagle eye, who feeds the players the weakness and strengths of their opponents. Meticulous in detailing, he is a data man out and out.

Throwdown specialists

Raghavindraa Dvgi

Kohli gives him credit

Aka Raghu, he is the senior-most among India’s three training assistants. Hailing from Kumta taluk in Uttara Kannada district, Raghu first became part of the Indian support staff back in 2011 during the tour of Australia. Endorsed by the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, he had also attended the fabled Ramakant Achrekar summer camps for a couple of years. Such was his tenacity to play the sport that Raghu once even took shelter in a Hubli graveyard when he didn’t have a place to stay. His impact as a throwdown specialist can be gauged from what former skipper Virat Kohli once said, “I believe the improvement this team has shown while playing fast bowling since 2013 has been because of Raghu.”

Nuwan Seneviratne

Ex-school bus driver

From Colombo, he is a former first-class cricketer who was part of the Sri Lankan set-up before he joined the Indian support staff in 2017. Unable to make more than two appearances on the domestic circuit back home, there was a time when Seneviratne earned his livelihood as a school bus driver.

Afghanistan to tour India for three-T20I series in January ahead of England Test series,"“India, we are coming again!”

Afghanistan Cricket Board would let know via their social media. Having impressed with their takedown of former World Cup champions in England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Afghanistan will visit the country in January for a three-match T20I series.

The first of the three games shall be played on January 11, 14 and 17. The series will be sandwiched between the India’s tour of South Africa – three T20Is, as many ODIs and two Tests – and the five-Test series against England at home starting early February.

Advertisement

It’ll be a first-ever three-match T20I series between the two nations. The two teams have played five T20Is against each other so far, with India having won four of them while their last contest – a gold medal match at Asian Games in Hangzhou – ended with no result. India however, were deemed winners being the higher seeded team going into the final.

At the 2023 ODI World Cup, the Rohit Sharma-led side emerged victorious against Hashmatullah Shahidi and Co by eight wickets with the Indian skipper scoring a record-seventh ton in the competition.

Afghanistan also have a Test match appearance under their belt in India, dating back to June 2018 – a game India won by an innings and 262 runs.",Sports
Coach Igor Stimac’s moves backfire as 0-3 defeat in World Cup qualifier to Qatar ends India’s 15-game unbeaten run at home,"It was hard to decipher India’s strategy against defending Asian champions Qatar at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. It was understandable that they wanted to defend against a team ranked 61st in the world, 41 places higher than them.

But in a vital FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier, India coach Igor Stimac decided to bench goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, undoubtedly the best player the last two times India faced the 2022 World Cup hosts. Not just that, the Croatian made four changes among the outfield players from the team that stunned Kuwait 1-0 in the opening game of the campaign.

The result of those changes was that India lacked coordination, especially when defending. And they were made to pay the price by their much taller, stronger, and in-sync opponents. The final scoreline read 0-3 but Stimac would know that the score could’ve been much more humiliating had Qatar converted even half of the chances they created.

This was more than just a World Cup qualifier for India. It was also their toughest preparatory game ahead of the AFC Asian Cup in January, where similar or tougher tests await them. It was a chance for Stimac to show that India has attacking flair and a solid defence. But with Amrinder Singh replacing Gurpreet, the defence led by Sandesh Jhingan looked shaky from the start. Amrinder looked overawed by the occasion and responsibility. He had a nightmarish game with the ball at his feet, giving it away three times in the first half itself.

Qatar were coming from a 8-1 thrashing over Afghanistan. Coached by Carlos Queiroz, who has managed the likes of Iran, Portugal and Real Madrid, they almost took the lead in the second minute when a misplaced pass from Amrinder allowed their star striker Almoez Ali to walk into the Indian box and square it to Akram Afif.

Just about four yards in front of goal, Afif fluffed his chance to send it wide much to the relief of the packed Kalinga Stadium, which had former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in attendance.

**EDS: IMAGE VIA @IndianFootball** Bhubaneswar: India’s Sunil Chhetri during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers match against Qatar, at Kalinga Stadium, in Bhubaneswar, Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023.

(PTI Photo)(PTI11_21_2023_000301B)

It didn’t take long for Qatar to redeem themselves, courtesy of some chaotic defending by India. Just two minutes later, India managed to head Afif’s corner out of the box, only for a Qatari player to send it back in. The ball pinballed in the Indian box and Udanta Singh’s failed clearance was met by the quick Mostafa Meshaal, who sent into the bottom corner.

An early goal seemed to ease the pressure of the away match and Qatar kept displaying their attacking flair and prowess, launching attack after attack, with the Indian defence just about managing to hold out.

Changes don’t work

In the defensive set-up, Stimac brought in Anirudh Thapa for Sahal Abdul Samad, and at left-back, he replaced Ashish Mishra with Subhasish Bose. Benching the in-form Mahesh Singh and starting with Udanta Singh was also a risk that didn’t pay off as India didn’t look threatening on counters.

It was only after the half-hour mark that India started showing glimpses of what they are capable of. Probably their best move of the match came in the 35th minute when Thapa and Udanta played a series of one-twos to enter the Qatar box before Thapa pulled it back for Apuia Ralte waiting at the top of the area. The Mumbai City FC playmaker, who was easily India’s best player in the match, skied his shot into the stands.

However, that attack gave India belief that they too could penetrate the Qatar defence, which leaked four goals against Iran in their last friendly.

Thapa had India’s best opportunity of the match in the 42nd minute when Sunil Chhetri’s persistence helped him rob a Qatari defender and play the ball to Thapa.

With just the goalkeeper to beat, Thapa tried to be cheeky and poke the ball from the edge of the box, but it was well wide of the target.

Qatar doubled their lead in the first minute of the second half, as Almoez got on the scoresheet. Boualem Khouki sold Lallianzuala Chhangte a dummy and floated a lovely ball out to Afif waiting in the box. Afif smashed it at goal and Amrinder could only palm it under his body but Almoez, Qatar’s record goalscorer who scored four against Afghanistan, slid in to take his tally to 80 for his country.

Stimac made two changes early in the second half, bringing in Mahesh in place of Udanta at the start and getting Sahal in place of Thapa a little later. It was then that India started combining well and looked threatening. Sahal had a good chance in the 65th minute, finding himself in acres of space inside the box after a brilliant through ball by Suresh Singh, but he dragged his left-footed shot wide, probably not realising how much time he actually had.

Qatar put the game to bed in the 85th minute with substitute Yusuf Abdurisag scoring with the simplest of headers at the near post, and just like that, India’s

15-game unbeaten run at home was broken.

While they were certainly outplayed, they did show that it was possible to create chances against Asia’s best. They, however, need to find a striker capable of making a nuisance of himself against tough defences, for as it stands, Stimac’s men are yet to register a shot on target in more than 270 minutes (three matches) against Qatar.",Sports

Pakistan names Wahab Riaz as head of national selection committee; Sohail Tanvir to head junior selection panel,"The overhaul in Pakistan cricket’s top echelons continues after the team’s ouster from the ongoing Cricket World Cup after a fifth-place finish in the group stage.

Just two days after former Test captain Mohammad Hafeez was entrusted the role of Team Director for the Pakistan men’s cricket team and Shan Masood and Shaheen Shah Afridi took over the reins of the national team from Babar Azam, the Pakistan Cricket Board picked two former Pakistan pacers to lead two crucial selection committees.

While former left-arm fast bowler Wahab Riaz was appointed as the chief selector of the national men’s selection committee, Sohail Tanvir was named as the head of the junior selection committee.

Riaz’s first assignment will be the selection of the national men’s squad for the three-match Test series against Australia from December 14 to January 7 in Australia and the five-match T20I series against New Zealand from January 12 to 21 in New Zealand. Riaz picked up 237 wickets and scored 1200 runs across the three formats after making his debut for Pakistan in 2008. He represented Pakistan in 27 Tests, 91 ODIs and 36 T20Is.

A PCB press release making the announcement quoted Riaz — who is Pakistan’s second-most successful bowler in World Cups, registering 35 wickets across three editions of the marquee event — as saying: “Heading a selection committee is a challenging task. We have a significant Australia tour coming up that is part of the ICC World Test Championship 2023-25 cycle and a T20I series against New Zealand that will allow us to develop a formidable unit leading up to the ICC T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies in June next year.

“I have a good rapport with the Pakistan Men’s Team Director Mohammad Hafeez and we will be working closely for the success of Pakistan cricket. My primary goal would be to give weightage to the top performers in domestic cricket and announce well-rounded squads equipped with the necessary skillsets. I will always be available to the players for feedback and advice.”

Meanwhile, Tanvir’s first assignment as chairperson of the junior selection committee will be the selection of the Pakistan U19 squad for the 2023 ACC U19 Asia Cup scheduled to be held between 8 and 17 December in UAE. Pakistan U19 will later take part in the ICC U19 World Cup from 13 January to 4 February in Sri Lanka.

Suryakumar Yadav likely to captain India in T20Is against Australia,"SURYAKUMAR Yadav is likely to lead the Indian team in the five-match T20I series against Australia with Hardik Pandya ruled out because of an injury he sustained during the World Cup. The series will begin on November 23 in Vizag and finish at Hyderabad on December 3.

The BCCI’s senior national selection committee is set to meet soon to pick the squad and given the series is coming close on the heels of the World Cup, a second-string team will be picked.

World no 1 batsman in T20 format, Yadav was appointed as the vice-captain of the T20 side during India’s tour of West Indies, where they played five matches in the Caribbean and US. With Pandya yet to recover from the ankle injury he suffered during the World Cup and a doubtful starter, the selecting committee headed by Ajit Agarkar is likely to elevate Yadav to the captaincy.

The 33-year-old Yadav has earlier led the Mumbai team and also India Under-23 team in the Emerging Cup a few years ago. His 360 style of play has gained him immense popularity and in a short time, Yadav has become the most lethal batsman in the world in the format.

The Indian Express understands that the selection committee will give rest to the majority of players who are part of the ongoing World Cup team. Players like Ishan Kishen and Prasidh Krishna, who didn’t get much of the World Cup game will be asked to play home series against Australia.

With Rahul Dravid’s contract coming to an end after the World Cup, the BCCI have asked VVS Laxman to coach the Indian team for a stop gap arrangement and the support staff of National Cricket Academy (NCA) will be asked to look after the team.

Reason for Yadav’s appointment is after the selection committee came to know that Pandya will take at least two months to recover fully from his ankle injury.

He is likely to miss three T20I and three ODI’s games against South Africa too.

It’s not clear whether Pandya needs surgery or not.",Sports
‘Sometimes it’s nice to see ball dominate bat’: Mitchell Starc after Australia beat South Africa at Eden Gardens,"Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood were the wreckers in chief for Australia after the Kangaroos bowled excellently in overcast conditions and reduced South Africa to 24/4 after Protea captain Bavuma won the toss and elected to bat.

However, David Miller’s rescue act took the South Africans to a respectable score of 212 but it was not enough as Pat Cummins made sure his team didn’t let the opportunity slip away in a low-scoring run-chase against South Africa in the semifinals on Thursday.

The captain had to bail out his team with the bat as he and Mitchell Starc got the Aussies home by three wickets in pursuit of a 213-run target.

After the match, the Aussie seamer spoke at length about the low-scoring thriller and the pitch at Eden Gardens.

” I think it was a tricky wicket throughout and I guess different phases of pressure for both teams throughout the game. So, yeah, I was pretty calm. I think Pat was pretty calm as well. And whilst it was pretty close, we had plenty of time. So, nice to squeeze past and make to a final,” Starc said while speaking at the post-match press conference.

However, Starc was a bit surprised at the nature of the surface and said, “Yeah, I’m certainly not going to say I’m one to read pitches and know what they do. I mean, training here the last few days, the practice wicket certainly turned a lot. From all reports, I think the wicket we played on has been used a few times so no surprise that it did turn. It is probably a little surprising that it did seam around a little bit whilst I said before it was pretty inconsistent pace wise, I think average first inning scores here have been sort of around 300 mark or a little bit higher. So yeah, a little bit surprising but you know sometimes it’s nice to see ball dominate bat.”

On a personal front with the ball, Starc, who picked 3/34, expressed happiness with his spell and said, “Yeah, that’s probably not been the tournament I would have liked from the get go but nice to step up in a big game. And I think our power play was probably what got us on our way. And there were other key moments through the day with bat and ball, but to start the game like that with Joshie [Hazelwood] and I, power play wickets have probably been not our strong suit through the tournament so it’s nice to have a power play of what two for 18 or something like that so the way Josh bowled throughout to finish two for 12 was incredible, and then Trav with bat and ball. I think a lot of guys in the field as well, the way Davey stepped up in the field and led by example. You could probably name everyone at different circumstances through the day to really step up in a big game.”",Sports
"Hardik Pandya, injured during World Cup, set to miss series against Australia, South Africa","All rounder Hardik Pandya will be out for at least another two months because of the ankle injury sustained when he tried to stop a ball off his own bowling in the World Cup league game against Bangladesh.

The Indian Express understands that Pandya will miss the upcoming T20I series at home against Australia and is also likely to miss three T20Is and three ODIs in South Africa.

The Baroda all-rounder lost his balance while trying to stop a shot from Bangladesh opener Liton Das and dragged his right boot while landing on the pitch. He got up and looked in discomfort as he stood on his haunches. Pandya was later rushed to the National Cricket Academy for rehabilitation and then ruled out from the ongoing World Cup.

The medical team is yet to take a call if Pandya needs a surgery.

Two weeks ago, Pandya was asked to bowl in the nets with strength and conditioning coaches advising him to increase speed slowly. The support staff didn’t want him to put too much pressure on his ankle. It is learnt that Pandya didn’t face any problem in the first three balls he bowled. He decided to increase the intensity of his bowling for the next delivery. It was during the fourth ball that he felt a bit of pain in his leg.

Pandya informed the support staff about the pain he felt on his right ankle. The NCA medical team decided to get another round of scans done.

Pandya had penned down a heartfelt message on the X: “Tough to digest the fact that I will miss out on the remaining part of the World Cup. I’ll be with the team, in spirit, cheering them on every ball of every game. Thanks for all the wishes, the love, and the support has been incredible. This team is special and I’m sure we’ll make everyone proud. Love, always, HP”.

ICC pitch consultant raises concerns about switching of pitch that might favour India if they reach ODI World Cup final,"ICC pitch consultant Andy Atkinson has raised questions whether the pitch for the final of the ICC World Cup to be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on November 19 will be prepared ‘without favouritism’.

The Daily Mail reported that Atkinson had flown to Ahmedabad last Friday to check on preparations for the final after being unsatisfied with the pitch changes being made to reportedly favour India, the home team.

The Indian Express reported on Tuesday that the Indian team management asked BCCI curators to shave off most of the grass on the Wankhede Stadium playing surface for their semifinal clash against New Zealand.

The management wanted a slow surface that will assist India’s world-class spinners.

India has performed well on slow tracks at home over the past few years. Before the World Cup, the team management had requested for their matches to be held on slow pitches.

Pitches at ICC events are prepared under the supervision of Atkinson, who agrees in advance with the home board which of the numbered strips on the square will be used for each game.

The Daily Mail report however says that the Ahmedebad Stadium has played three of the four group games on different surfaces from those on the schedule. And Atkinson fears the same could happen if India reach the final on Sunday.

Atkinson’s recommendation was that the final should be played on pitch No 5, which has been used only once, though he learned last week that pitch No 6 – which has been used twice – could get the nod to bring India’s spinners into play.

In his email, Atkinson warns: “As a result of these actions, one must speculate if this will be the first ever ICC CWC (cricket World Cup) final to have a pitch which has been specifically chosen and prepared to their stipulation at the request of the team management and/or the hierarchy of the home nation board.”

He added: “Or will it be selected or prepared without favouritism for either of the sides competing in the match in the usual manner, and unquestionably because it is the usual pitch for the occasion?”",Sports

I said in Kolkata, the great man (Sachin Tendulkar) just congratulated me. All this feels like a dream, too good to be true. Feels surreal for me. Again a big game today, I had to play the role I have played throughout the tournament so that the guys around me can go and express themselves. Just glad everything came together so nicely and we put up a great total on the board as well. (On how he gets the consistency going) Most important thing is to make my team win and whatever it takes to do that I am ready to do that. Whether running singles and doubles, hitting boundaries... whatever the team wants me to do. I have been given a role this tournament and I have been trying to play that to the best of my abilities - try to dig deep and bat long so the guys around me can play around me and have that confidence in the later overs where I can dominate with the bat as well.

(On his celebration after reaching the hundred) As I said stuff of dreams. Anushka was sitting right there, Sachin paaji was here too. Difficult to explain this. If I could paint a perfect picture I would want this to be the picture. My life partner, the person I love the most is sitting there, my hero is sitting there and I was able to get the 50th (ODI hundred) in front of all of them and all these stands in Wankhede as well, such a history venue so it was amazing. (Assessing the team's innings) In a big game you are happy with anything over 330-340. To get close to 400 is amazing. Lot of credit has to go to Shreyas the way he came and batted freely.. Shubman and Rohit at the top, KL finishing with the flurry... I think everyone did their roles to perfection and did the job beautifully for the team. A perfect batting performance but just one half of the game is done. Still got to go out there and be professional with the ball and do the things we have done in the tournament so far.",Sports
‘Don’t even go there… want to ask Sachin where he played that shot’: Ravi Shastri on Tendulkar statue that looks like Steve Smith,"Ahead of India’s clash against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium earlier this month, Sachin Tendulkar’s statue was unveiled at the Mumbai stadium as a tribute to his illustrious career. However, some fans observed on social media that the statue resembled Australian cricketer Steven Smith more than Tendulkar. This also led to many memes on social media.

On a recent episode of Club Prairie Fire podcast, former England cricketer Michael Vaughan cheekily asked Ravi Shastri what Tendulkar would think of his Steve Smith lookalike statue.

“Don’t even go there! I have not even met him. So I have not asked him. I’d like to pick his brain on what he thinks (about it). Where did he play that shot?

“I will know from his face whether he is happy with that statue or he is not because it won’t be long to know,” he added.

40-over games in ODI

As the World Cup has chugged along, there has been plenty of debate about the future of the 50-over format. The former India coach weighed in, suggesting that the format should be reduced to 40 overs. “I think changes have to be made. When we won the World Cup in 83 it was a 60-over game it changed to 50 overs. You have to evolve with time, you have to see the attention span of the spectator. It is diminishing. I think the way forward would be a 40-over game.”

Shastri also highlighted viewer behaviour of those who visit the grounds to watch their team play, saying they are interested in just certain phases of the format.

“I see it with the crowds. They wait to see what has happened at the toss. If their favourite team is batting they rush to the ground they will watch the game they will watch 10 overs or 15 overs of powerplay of the second innings and they are off. They are off to see the game somewhere else. It’s the other way around if it’s too hot or India is batting second. Fans are going to reach the ground at 5 o’clock to see the last 10 or 12 overs of the first innings and then they want to see my team bat.

“It is the attention span which is changing amongst youngsters. They don’t have time to watch cricket for eight hours especially since you have everything on your phone these days. They choose the right time to go,” he added.

The ongoing World Cup has suffered from poor crowds at times in stadiums and a lack of close games which has brought the format’s future further under scrutiny.",Sports
"England vs Pakistan Highlights, World Cup 2023: ENG defeat PAK by 93 runs, secure Champions Trophy qualification","Pakistan captain Babar Azam during a practice session ahead of the match against Bangladesh at Eden Gardens in Kolkata last month. Express photo by Partha Paul.

Babar Azam defends captaincy: ‘I am under no pressure, I’ve been doing this for the last two-three years’

The festival season drags on in the City of Joy. The first time Pakistan landed here, Kolkata was hungover from the Durga Puja. Two weeks later, as they return for one last time in the World Cup. Diwali and Kali Puja are ushering in. But the mood in their camp, though, would be far from festive, as their semifinal hopes are as bleak as reaching on time for a function in the city during the festival time, as you would be bumping into one block after the other.

Similarly, Pakistan have most avenues to the semifinals reaching dead-ends. All but the dreamers and romantics would still nurse hopes of them reaching the last four, in which case they would encounter India in a dream knockout match. To achieve that, though, they need to beat England by 287 runs if they bat first or with 284 balls to spare if they are chasing. Pakistan captain Babar Azam semi-seriously said: “I think there is one match left. You never know. It is cricket.” He turned a bit philosophical too: “There should be hope at all times. At any stage, at any work you do, you should have positive hope and I firmly believe in that.” (READ MORE)",Sports

"‘Learn from India, create a bigger pool of players’: Shoaib Malik’s advice PCB after Pakistan fail to qualify for the semifinals","Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has suggested the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) should take a cue from the Indian cricket and make a bigger pool in every format.

“In this World Cup, India were covered from all the aspects. I am not talking about only three departments — bowling, batting and fielding,” Malik said on A Sports.

“They have suffered injuries as well but they kept their plan B ready. Moving forward, having a pool of players is going to be most important. Pool of players in every format and they should get equal chance so that when the opportunity comes, they are ready.

“We do go in the rebuilding process, but we don’t stick to our own decisions. We don’t work consistently on our decisions,” he added.

Malik’s co-panelist and former teammate, Misbah suggested the inability to take constructive criticism when team is doing well has cost them badly.

“After winning every series and food performances, we are not ready to hear anything about improvement. I am not only talking about the players, it is overall,” said Misbah.

“When Team is winning, doing well then why are you pointing out. You need consistent improvement, even if you are winning.

“We should point out the areas, where we can work. Playing against good teams, in good tournaments can give you a better picture. Those who will talk about it, the entire system will be against you,” he said.

Misbah also lamented Pakistan spinners, who were exposed once the pacers were gone for runs.

“When your pacers were doing well, they covered the weakness of our spinners. As a team management, you do keep an eye on things that are not working, where we need improvement.

“You can’t close your eyes on those areas. In the pressure situation against big teams those things will haunt you. Then again NRR things will come up,” said Misbah.

Wasim Akram and Moin Khan said the Pakistan players looked fatigues.

“There were lack of planning and poor fitness,” said Moin.

Sourav Ganguly’s tribute to Virender Sehwag: ‘You changed dynamics of batting at top in Tests’,"Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has showered praise on Virender Sehwag, who has been included in the ICC Hall of Fame.

“You changed the dynamics of batting at the top in Test cricket. Your talent was special. You scored runs at such a fast pace, you were just exceptionally good, and you are probably the best opening batsman after Sunil Gavaskar,” Ganguly wrote in his letter to Sehwag.

Ganguly recalls how he first heard about Sehwag and what was his specialty that made him different from the others.

“That is how I first heard of you. The India selectors kept updating us that you were very good, and you came into the international set-up early on,” said Ganguly.

The former India captain also revealed why the Delhi batsman was bit tentative when he asked him to open for the first time in a Test match at Lord’s in 2002.

“I remember when I told you that you should try opening, you were unsure because you had never done it,” said Ganguly.

“I believe no-one is born to bat in any particular position and that you could do it because of the talent you possessed.

“You were initially tentative but once you got going for the first time in a Test match at Lord’s in 2002, you got an 80 in no time. From there, your confidence continued to grow.”

Ganguly admitted Sehwag was a better Test batter and explained: “You enjoyed playing all the different formats and while you were good at one-day cricket, I think you were even better in Tests.

“You could do it in all conditions and your triple hundred in Multan remains one of my favourite innings. You hit a six to get to 200 and then did the same to get to 300 – and you had told us you were going to do it too!

Glenn Maxwell says teammates said he looked like ‘salmon on ground shaking’ during match-winning double-century,"Glenn Maxwell produced one of the most astonishing Cricket World Cup innings by smashing 201 not out off 128 balls on Tuesday to lead Australia past Afghanistan with 19 deliveries to spare and into the semifinals.

Maxwell finished his highest ODI knock, unable to run between the wickets because of cramps, just slashing the ball over the boundary without moving his legs as Australia chased down its target of 292. He hit 21 fours as well as 10 sixes, the last coming off the final ball of the match.

The allrounder came to the rescue after Australia slumped to 91-7 in reply to Afghanistan’s 291-5.

In a recent interaction with Fox Cricket, the Aussies star recalled a few hilarious mid-pitch conversations with skipper Pat Cummins and revealed how it helped him battle through the grind.

“There’s plenty of banter being thrown around in the changeroom. Pat sort of walked in and thrown his helmet on the ground and gone, ‘Can’t believe it. My strike rate’s cooked. Unbelievable. Jesus. I shouldn’t have knocked back all those singles,” Maxwell said.

Pat Cummins finished on an unbeaten 12 runs off 68 balls.

“Obviously we’re all getting taken the mickey out of. I’m getting taken the mickey out of for not being able to run properly, like a salmon on the ground shaking. It was just such a great feeling in the changeroom. It reminded me of the T20 World Cup in 2021, the same sort of feeling — energetic, electric, exciting and everyone felt like they were heading towards the same end goal. Who knows, it could be the same here,” Maxwell added.

On the upcoming clash against the Proteas in the semis, he said that the team is confident about their abilities. “It’s pretty exciting for our group to have that belief. We’ve got four different century makers in our line-up (Maxwell, David Warner, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh). Guys who you feel are primed, ready to go, on the cusp of doing something special. I just can’t see a better lead in for us. Hopefully we’re in a positive frame of mind to take them down,” explained Maxwell.",Sports
