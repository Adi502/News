JEE Main 2024: When should I start giving mock tests?,"— Ajay Sharma

The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main is a highly competitive entrance test that opens the door to some of India’s finest engineering colleges. Mock tests are an essential part of the preparation process for the aspiring engineers who invest years of time and energy into successfully passing this test. We’ll go into the importance of mock exams in this blog and when it’s best to include them in your JEE Main preparation plan.

Understanding the purpose of mock tests:

Mock tests are like practice runs for the real deal, offering students a chance to gauge their strengths and weaknesses, fine-tune their time management skills, and get comfortable with the exam format and atmosphere. They can also help boost confidence, minimize exam stress, and sharpen problem-solving abilities. It’s clear that including mock tests in your study schedule is crucial for thorough preparation.

Early phase of preparation:

The journey to cracking JEE Main is a marathon, not a sprint. Beginning your mock test early in your preparation phase can provide you with important insights into your current level of understanding and identify areas that require more attention. Starting with mock tests in the early phase helps in preparing a base and understanding the exam pattern, making it easier to create a targeted study plan.

As a rule of thumb, initiating mock tests about 3 to 4 months before the actual examination can be beneficial. For example, in 2024, the first phase of JEE Main is scheduled in January, so the early phase for the same was around September to October. So those students who have already done this part or planning to do it now, have completed their early phase of preparation. This allows ample time for both self-study and targeted improvement based on your performance in the mock tests.

Mid-preparation phase:

The mid-phase of your JEE Main preparation gets increasingly important as you move forward because it’s when you may sharpen your abilities and adjust your strategies. By this point, you should have covered a significant portion of the syllabus. Incorporating mock tests into your routine during this stage helps you assess your progress, identify weak areas, and focus on refining your time management skills.

Around 2 to 3 months before the examination, consider taking full-length mock tests on a regular basis. This not only helps in building stamina for the lengthy exam but also provides a realistic preview of the actual test conditions. Analysing your performance in these mock tests will enable you to prioritize topics and allocate your study time more efficiently.

"Bags packed with books & dreams, 780 girls board train from Jammu for nationwide study tour","Jammu and Kashmir’s new College on Wheels rolled out of Katra railway station on Sunday with its first batch of 780 girls — all college students from different parts of the Union Territory. For many of them, it was their first train journey, and their first time venturing out of J&K.

Travelling on a special train named JK Gyanodaya Express, they reached their first stop – Delhi – on Monday. Over the next two weeks, the train will further take them to various other parts of the country, including Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, with the aim of imparting hands-on knowledge about the cultural wealth and heritage of India.

College on Wheels is an initiative of the J&K Higher Education Council, and is being spearheaded by Jammu University, said JU Vice-Chancellor Umesh Rai. The students will do projects related to different subjects while on their travels. This, Rai said, would “dissolve the boundaries” of their subject of study, and also dissolve the four walls of classrooms that keep students constrained inside.

Among hundreds of excited students thronging the platform to board the College on Wheels at Katra railway station was Sofia Hafeez, an undergraduate student from the Government Degree College in Kashmir’s Beerwah.

“It is my first time travelling outside J&K, and also my first train journey,” she said, adding that she was excited at the opportunity to meet and interact with people from other states.

Like Sofia, Sumaira Zubeen also expressed her excitement at the prospect of visiting places outside the UT. A postgraduate student of Islamic Studies at Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University in Rajouri, she said she was looking forward to “observing the lives, culture, food habits and attire” of people from different parts of the country.

The students on the train were chosen on the basis of their project proposals, said the JU V-C. In July, students were asked to submit project proposals in their colleges, out of which the shortlisted ones were chosen to be a part of the College of Wheels.

A group of seven-eight students from multiple disciplines of study work together on one project, Rai said. Each student group will be headed by a mentor.

The projects the student groups are working on include those titled ‘From Bharat, Beyond Earth’, ‘A New Thought On An Old Subject’, ‘A Friend Who Taught Me A Language On The Train’, and even ‘Shopping On Wheels’.

Teams of doctors and paramedical staff of the IRTC, the UT administration and JU, as well as personnel of the J&K Police and the RPF will accompany the students.

There is a library on the train, and the students are encouraged to read at least one book during the journey. They will have access to laptops to work on their projects, and will also give presentations during the journey, Rai said.

When the train arrived at the Safdarjung railway station in Delhi on Monday, 22-year-old Shivani Sharma stepped out onto the platform feeling both nervous and excited. She had never travelled outside of J&K before.

“This is only the second time I have sat inside a train in my whole life. I was very young the first time around, so I don’t remember much of that experience. This project is the first time I got an opportunity to get out of J&K,” said Shivani, who is doing a postgraduate course in JU.

Her team is working on a project on the ‘Food Culture’ in different parts of India.

“We have prepared questionnaires for people… In each state we visit, we will interact with people in those states and find out about what they like to eat the most, where they like to eat, and so on,” she said.

Like Shivani, 22-year-old Pawandeep Kaur is also visiting the national capital for the first time. “This is going to be a new learning experience, and I am excited to visit the Rashtrapathi Bhawan and the Parliament House,” she said.

Explaining her project on PCOS and breast cancer awareness, the JU student said: “We have prepared questionnaires regarding PCOS and breast cancer issues amongst women, and we will approach local girls in each state that we are going to visit. By the end of this journey, we aim to educate women on how they can take care of their lifestyle and health. We are hoping to put together a report that we aim to publish.”

In Delhi, the students will visit both the old and new buildings of Parliament, as well as the Rashtrapati Bhawan. They will then proceed to Ahmedabad, where they will visit the Sabarmati Ashram. In Mumbai, they will visit the Naval Dockyard, IIT-Mumbai and the Gateway of India. Then in Goa, they will visit the Hansa Naval Air Station, and in Bengaluru, they will visit the Indian Institute of Science and Technology, and ISRO. They will also go to Wadhra, where they will visit the Paunar Ashram and other sightseeing spots. They will then return to Delhi and finally to Jammu on December 2.

The J&K administration is spending around 4.75 crore on the initiative.

Vice-chairman of the J&K Higher Education Council and former V-C of Delhi University, Dinesh Singh, said train journeys had inspired Mahatma Gandhi, and hoped that this journey would do the same for these students.

“This entire journey is for these young women to inspire themselves with Gandhi’s philosophy, and to discover themselves on this train like Gandhi did. Education is not just bound to a classroom with a blackboard. It is so much more than that,” he said.

“There will be two charkhas on board and there will be a competition, the girls who spin the charkhas the fastest will be rewarded with a book,” he said.",Education

"‘Pressure’ from parents behind student suicides, says Supreme Court","“Intense competition” and “pressure” of parents on their wards preparing for competitive exams are the main reasons for the rising number of suicides across the country, the Supreme Court said on Monday.

Hearing a plea that sought regulation of the mushrooming coaching institutes and cited the data on student suicides, a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti, however, expressed helplessness and said the judiciary cannot pass directions in such a scenario.

“These are not easy things. Pressure from parents is behind all these incidents. More than the children, it is the parents who are putting pressure on them. How can the court pass directions in such a scenario,” the bench told advocate Mohini Priya, appearing for the petitioner – Mumbai-based doctor Aniruddha Narayan Malpani.

Justice Khanna said, “Although, most of us will not want any coaching institute to be there, but look at the conditions of schools. There is intense competition and students have no other option but to go to these coaching institutes.” Referring to the 2020 data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Priya said it highlights that around 8.2 per cent of students in the country die by suicide.

The bench said that it knows about the situation but the court can’t pass directions and suggested that the petitioner instead approach the government with his suggestions.

Priya sought to withdraw the plea to approach the appropriate forum, which the court allowed.

The plea filed by Malpani through Priya said that it seeks appropriate directions for regulating the conduct of “profit-hungry private coaching institutes mushrooming across India which provide coaching for various competitive entrance examinations such as IIT-JEE (Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination) and NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)”.

Advertisement

It said that the petitioner has been constrained to approach the court as several students have died by suicide in recent years “facilitated by the absolute lack of regulation and oversight by the Respondents (Centre and state governments)”.

“Children as young as 14 years enter these coaching factories often away from their homes and undergo rigorous preparation in the anticipation of getting admission to a good medical or engineering college.

“After being in a protected home environment, the child is suddenly exposed to the harsh competitive world without being mentally equipped to do so. These profit-hungry coaching institutes, however, do not care about student well-being and are only focussed on minting money leading to the youth of India being pressurised enough to take their own lives,” the petition said.

It said that children are being made to live and study in these coaching factories in subpar and abnormal conditions which are severely affecting their mental health.

“What is most dangerous about mental health is that it is invisible, unlike other ailments in our body. However, just like other physical ailments, mental health problems too are triggered by extrinsic forces, surrounding environment and pressures,” it said.

The plea said that student suicides were a grave human rights concern.

“The lackadaisical attitude of the Centre in enacting a law despite the rising number of suicides clearly reflects upon the State’s apathy towards protecting these young minds who are the future of our country and their constitutional right to live with dignity guaranteed under Article 21,” the plea alleged.",Education

"IIT-Madras launches information platform on accelerators, incubators","The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras’ Centre for Research on Start-ups and Risk Financing (CREST) has developed the country’s first information platform on incubators and accelerators.

The platform is developed in partnership with YNOS, an IIT Madras-incubated start-up. The information platform will contain comprehensive information on incubators and accelerators, which seeks to play an important role in helping start-ups navigate an uncertain entrepreneurial ecosystem.

India had about 1,000 active incubators, but until now, the information about them was scattered and not easily available in a single location, an IIT Madras statement said. Entrepreneurs, the institute said, had to spend a lot of time and effort to identify the incubator most suitable for their start-up.

The platform would address this pain point and help the start-up founders to identify, compare and analyse incubators very easily and would shortlist one that best fits their requirements.

The incubator platform has been developed using the latest technology tools to quickly analyse the incubator and accelerator landscape in India. It features intuitive filters on multiple incubator parameters to quickly identify the set of incubators that satisfy different criteria for shortlisting and a facility to bookmark shortlisted incubators for detailed assessment at a later stage.",Education
Toppers’ Tips: ‘I started CUET UG preparation after my board exams’,"Dishank Gandhi took the CUET in its debut edition in 2022. He appeared for four papers – history, political science, English and psychology and topped the Common University Entrance Test UG with 800/800 marks.

He scored an overall pass percentage of 92 per cent in Class 10 and 94.8 per cent in Class 12. Currently pursuing BA (Hons) History from St Stephen’s College at Delhi University, the topper shares how he prepared for the CUET.

My CUET experience

I relied on self-study. Although I mainly focussed on NCERT books for CUET UG preparation, I did not keep my preparation strategy restricted. I delved deeper into concepts and topics. I used the internet to garner more knowledge on the topics in addition to the NCERTs.

Advertisement

I started my CUET preparation after my board exams were over. The only additional thing that I felt would require attention was the CBSE deleted portions. I did not want to complicate my board exams by including CUET preparation.

The entrance test was not difficult as almost all the questions were directly related to the NCERT books. However, I was heavily impacted by the mismanagement of CUET. After coming out from my exam centre, I came to know that the paper got cancelled as many were unable to complete their biometric attendance. On the next day, I was affected by Covid. On the revised test date, I was ill and weak.

Why did I choose St Stephen’s College?

I chose St Stephen’s because it is one of the best colleges in India as per many rankings. St Stephen’s was my first preference. I also added some programmes of Hindu College as my preferences.

Advise for CUET UG aspirants

– Focus on the board exams first

Advertisement

– Do not complicate the board preparation by including CUET UG preparation pressure

– Try to be consistent with the preparation

– Focus on accumulating knowledge, rather than an exam

Life in St Stephen’s College

The highly renowned faculty goes out of their traditional roles as teachers to help the students in every way they can, whether it is about studies, their future prospects or anything else.

After getting admission to St Stephen’s College, I am realising that the colleges do not matter as much as the programme. Internship and direct placement scopes are very low for a history student like me. So I have enrolled in several skill-enhancement courses like IT, coding, Java, SQL and Python programming languages.

IIFT exam 2015: All You Need to Know About the Test Pattern,"The IIFT entrance exam is scheduled for November 22, 2015. We tell you what would be the general pattern of the exam. Take a look.

The general pattern includes four sections — General Awareness, English Usage, Reading Comprehension (sub part of section 2), Logical Reasoning, Data Interpretation and Quantitative Ability (sub part of section 4). Overall 118-128 questions are asked where attempting 80 is counted good.

The first section has 25-30 questions and relatively takes less time. The second section includes a total number of 40-45 questions and is divided in two sub parts. Part 1 is English Usage and part 2 Reading Comprehension. You can score a good 16 marks by dedicating not more than 25 minutes to this section.

Section 3 (Logical Reasoning) is time consuming and takes around 30 minutes. But you can score 14 marks in this section.

Section 4 is again divided in two parts — Data Interpretation and Quantitative Ability. Around 20 questions are offered in the former and you can easily attempt six. While in the latter (Quantitative Ability), you can achieve around a good 13 marks.

For the 2015-17 batch, IIFT had shortlisted 1,411 candidates for the final round of Essay Writing, Group Discussion and Interview. IIFT has an intake of about 200-250.

However, the actual cut-offs for calls for the GDPI process is much higher than these mentioned above.

IIFT is a two hour exam and therefore is a test of speed. As there is a differential marking scheme, the candidate should lay emphasis on solving more questions from the sections in which each question carries more weightage.

The candidates who clear the cut-off are shortlisted for the further stages of the selection procedure. The shortlisted candidates are then called for Essay GD-PI round. The Essay GD-PI is usually conducted in the month of Feb-March.
