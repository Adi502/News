Ronit Roy says he addressed Hrithik Roshan as ‘sir’ on Kaabil to take the ‘safe route’: ‘Hrithik said I have a problem with you’,"Ronit Roy worked with Hrithik Roshan in the 2017 film Kaabil. In a recent interview, Ronit recalled the time he spent with Hrithik on the shoot of the film. Ronit said that although he had known the actor for many years, he had never worked with the star so when he landed up on set, he found it best to address him as ‘sir’. But this didn’t go well with Hrithik as he objected to it the next day.

“I was cast in a film where he is the star so you don’t really know what to do so you take the safe route. So I said, ‘Good morning, sir.’ He is the lead of the film so the safest way is to call him sir,” Ronit shared with Lehren Retro. The actor said that he had spent time with Hrithik before but the two had actually never worked together. He recalled that the after the first day went by, Hrithik called him to his van the next day.

Vir Das on International Emmy win for Best Comedy: ‘I hope we all just get sillier’,"He’s still “just a guy on a stool” for whom the audience’s laughter will always be more precious than accolades, says Vir Das, the first Indian comic to win an International Emmy Award.

Das won the award for his Netflix stand-up special Vir Das: Landing in the best comedy category at a ceremony in New York on Monday night. He tied with the much acclaimed British series Derry Girls for the coveted prize.

“The job is to take the beautiful chosen people of the world and humanise them a little bit by making an idiot out of myself… I hope we all just get sillier and continue to be fools,” the actor-comic, who returned home on Wednesday, told PTI in a virtual interview.

The future of the Indian comedy scene is “tremendous”, the 41-year-old said.

“I’m underslept. The phone has been going a little insane. But I’m just grateful. I don’t think anything has fully sunk in yet. Luckily, I have a long flight back to India to process all of it.”

An award, he said, is a gift and recognition laughter.

“In my speech, I made sure to thank the Indian people for their laughter. I said it was the soundtrack to my life,” he said.

Injecting a note of reality as he celebrates his first International Emmy trophy, Vir Das said it will get him “maybe 30 seconds extra applause” when he walks out on the stage. After that, it will only be about the laughs.

“I will have to make them (the audience) laugh. At the end of the day, they will be like, ‘We have paid for this, so make us laugh.'”

Das, who has often courted trouble over his quirky, observational performances and social media posts, is already readying for shows in Chandigarh and Bengaluru.

He was one of the three Indians to be nominated at the 51st International Emmy Awards along with Shefali Shah for Delhi Crime season two (Netflix) and Jim Sarbh for Rocket Boys (SonyLIV). Besides, producer Ektaa R Kapoor of Balaji Productions was honoured with the International Emmy Directorate Award.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vir Das (@virdas)

The comic said there was “a bit of suspense” at the awards gala when the winner for best comedy category was going to be announced because two envelopes made an appearance on the stage all of a sudden.

“I tied with ‘Derry Girls’, one of the best shows in the world,” he added.

That they were surprised to hear their name called out is generally a cliched response but the comedian said he only went to the International Emmy Awards with the intent to root for Shefali Shah, who was vying for a win in the best performance by an actress category. She was bested by Karla Souza of La Caida, a Mexican show.

“I really considered my job to be there to root for Shefali. She is a once-in-a-generation talent… I was just kind of focusing my energy on her. I was genuinely surprised (when I won).

“As much as Netflix India is gigantic and has a worldwide footprint, I’m still just a guy on a stool. So, to be in a category with Derry Girls, which is a massive Netflix show, itself is an achievement. So, when they said (the winner is) Vir Das: Landing, I was very, very surprised,” he said.

Vir Das kind of fumbled his way up to the stage, but he got his thank yous right which was very important.

“I said many things. The second I got off the stage, I panicked (wondering) did I thank everyone? I hope I didn’t mess it up. (I said to myself) No, you thanked your wife, your family, Netflix and everybody who worked on it.”

Vir Das: Landing is Das’ fourth special with Netflix. This was his second nod at the International Emmys; first one, also with the streamer, was for Vir Das: For India in 2021.

Through Vir Das: Landing, the aim was to tell the world what his “idea of home” is, the comic said.

He was born in Dehradun and spent the first 14 years of his life in Lagos, Nigeria. He has also lived in Haryana, Delhi-NCR, and the US.

Das, who is now based out of Mumbai, said he is fortunate to be a “global Indian comedy voice”.

“I get to travel the world. It’s a tremendous privilege. What that comes with is I spend eight months a year missing home sometimes during a world tour. The germ of the show is from there. I miss home and a lot of times if I’m in New York or London, there are 3,000 people in the room, out of which 1,500 are Indians who haven’t been in a room with so many Indians in a really long time. You are their catch-up, their update with home. That’s what the central feeling of the show was. I don’t think there could be a better stage for the show to get some love than an international stage,” he said.

His win comes almost a month after the sudden demise of popular American actor and comedian Matthew Perry. The late actor is best known for the popular 1990s sitcom Friends, in which he played the iconic role of socially awkward but amiable Chandler Bing who uses sarcasm to get by in life.

Das, who had shared a heartfelt tribute for Perry on social media after his passing, said the Friends star essayed his part like a lovable fool.

“The jester’s job, the joker’s job, the fool’s job is to make fun of people to make them seem beautiful. That’s what Matthew Perry did very well in a scene. He made the other person look good by being how silly he could be.”

Vir Das, also known for films such as Go Goa Gone, Delhi Belly, and Love Aaj Kal, has several acting projects lined up for 2024.

“I just wrapped up a show which should be out soon… I co-directed a feature that goes on floor in February that I’ll star in. It will be my co-directorial debut of sorts. I should have an American piece of content out soon too. It (2024) is an acting year, a heavy acting year,” he said.

While the Primetime Emmy Awards recognise shows produced in America, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences conducts the International Emmys with the aim to honour “the world’s best television”.",Bollywood

"Mukesh Chhabra says Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki will ‘break all records’, calls it film of a lifetime: ‘100 times better than 3 Idiots’","Casting director Mukesh Chhabra says working on Rajkumar Hirani’s upcoming feature Dunki starring Shah Rukh Khan was an unforgettable experience, as he got to work on a project which he feels will be remembered for years to come.

The social comedy drama marks the first collaboration of Shah Rukh and Rajkumar Hirani, known for acclaimed blockbusters like Sanju, PK, 3 Idiots and the Munna Bhai series. Dunki is billed as a “big journey film” about a group of people wanting to return home — their country India.

In an interview with Indianexpress.com, Mukesh Chhabra, who will be next seen in the Sony LIV musical thriller Chamak, opened up about casting for Dunki and said it is going to be a film that will be “remembered for the next ten years.” This will be Shah Rukh’s third release of the year after Pathaan and Jawan.

“Raju Hirani is an entire film school, working with him is like a film institute. You learn every aspect of filmmaking when you work with that guy. I have done all his ads, PK and Sanju, so I have spent a lot of time. His casting doesn’t get over in a month, it goes on for 2 years because that man eats, breathes, sleeps films.

“When I read the script of Dunki, I was blown away. If you loved 3 idiots, it is going to be 100 times better than that. I have cried whenever I have read the script. Everytime,” he said about the film, which will release on December 21.



Chhabra said he feels fortunate that he gets to work with “immensely talented” makers like Hirani. The casting director said Dunki will remind people of the simplicity of timeless Indian classics.

“The film will break all the records. It is the purest form of filmmaking, like how we remember Anand, Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s films, Do Aankhen Barah Haath? Same way you will be talking about Dunki for many, many years to come. I mean it. Every piece of my heart feels this,” he added.

Mukesh Chhabra, who was seen in a special appearance in Jawan, will be now seen in Sony LIV series Chamak.

Dunki song Lutt Putt Gaya: Shah Rukh Khan is undisputed King of Romance and the way he looks at Taapsee is proof,"Fans of Shah Rukh Khan have a reason to cheer as the first song of his upcoming film, Dunki is out now. Titled, “Lutt Putt Gaya,” the romantic number is picturised on the actor and his ladylove in the film, Taapsee Pannu.

In the song, SRK’s character Hardy looks head over heels in love with Taapsee’s Manu. In a dream sequence, Hardy is expressing his love for Manu while dancing around his village. Choreographer Ganesh Acharya has given SRK some unusual dance steps which might make you miss the staple SRK style of dancing.

The last shot of Hardy lovingly staring at Manu while she is saying her prayers at a gurdwara is the highlight of the song. It reminds you how good Shah Rukh is at romancing his leading ladies.
