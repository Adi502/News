"Telangana polls: An Independent, ‘buffalo sister’ has a bull run, powered by volunteers and social media","They call her “Barrelu akka (buffalo sister)”, and very quickly Karne Shireesha stands apart from the herd.

The 26-year-old, who has joined the Telangana race from Kollapur in Nagarkurnool as an Independent – to raise the issues, among others, of the unemployed – is now a social media star.

A team of volunteers, some of them Shireesha’s fellow students from Hyderabad’s Osmania University, as well as others from Kakatiya University, are powering her campaign via catchy songs, which are in turn being amplified by influencers and YouTubers, and other people.

All in all, in the couple of days since she filed her candidature, Shireesha’s handle ‘princessbarrelakka’ has gained over 4 lakh followers across social media, such as Instagram, Facebook and YouTube.

Two songs in particular have gone viral – ‘Pedalikiakka, barrelakka (Sister of the poor, our barrelakka)’; and ‘Nuvu whistle este vinapadtadi Andhra daka, barrelakka (If you whistle, it will be heard till Andhra, barrelakka)’.

And it all began with those buffaloes, rather a video of the B.Com graduate who has failed to find a job tending to cattle. Shireesha admits she was baffled when that video “became such a hit”.

But, she was also not very surprised. “I have only a B.Com degree but there are others who have done M.Phil or PhD and still remain unemployed… I speak about the youth who are highly educated but do not have jobs,’’ Shireesha says, explaining why the video may have struck a chord.

Her “fight” now is for all the poor, she adds. “The condition of the poor in my village and mandal remains the same.” She blames the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi, which has been in power since Telangana was formed, saying it has let down the youth and poor.

The first to attend college in her family, which makes a living rearing buffaloes and selling milk, she claims to have just Rs 6,500 in her bank account. But her supporters have been pitching in, including with money for vehicles. A former MLA and ex-Puducherry minister, Malladi Krishna Rao, gave Rs 1 lakh. Various organisations like the pro-farmer Rythu Swaraj Vedika have extended support.

Some have set up mini-studios at their homes to record the songs that are her campaign theme.

“A number of students like me are coming to support her,’’ says R Venkatesh.

Shireesha is up against BRS sitting MLA Harshvardhan Reddy and the Congress’s Jupally Krishna Rao – two candidates who have been a constant in the seat for at least the past two polls, though their parties have seen a neat exchange.

In 2014, Rao (then in the BRS) had been the winner, beating Reddy (then in the Congress), getting 46.86% votes. In 2018, it was Reddy (still in the Congress) who had defeated Rao (still in the BRS), getting 46.36% of the votes.

Rao chuckles when asked about Shireesha’s campaign. “Videos on the phone (meaning Instagram) do not get votes. You have to know the pulse of the people before you decide to contest. I am a five-time former MLA, I know what the opinion of the people is. Political novices, especially those who think they can contest because they are stars (on social media) have no clue about politics. She at best adds colour to the campaign,” he says.

Reddy agrees with his bitter rival about the importance of leaders like them. “What a sitting MLA like me has done for the people, and what they expect, only a seasoned politician can understand. I know there are some issues regarding public service exams, but that issue far outweighs the good work that the BRS has done with its numerous welfare schemes,” Reddy says.

On Tuesday afternoon, unknown persons beat up Shireesha’s brother K Chintu, while they were campaigning at Kothapalli. They lodged a police complaint, and the sub-inspector of Peddakothapalli Police Station said they were investigating the matter.

While that happens, the video of a weeping Shireesha calling up the police hiding in a vehicle has gone viral.",Political
"Rajasthan polls: After jugglery to accommodate Diya Kumari, BJP’s safe seat in choppy waters","In Chittorgarh’s Gandhi Nagar square, Gopal Purabia is having a tough time convincing his customers to vote for the BJP. Purabia who runs the “Namo tea stall” at the square is a BJP worker and a Narendra Modi fan. So are his customers. But they are rooting for rebel candidate and sitting MLA Chandrabhan Singh Akya who has been overlooked as the party tried to make accommodations after fielding Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari from a seat in Jaipur.

As the conversation at the tea stall illustrates, this has put Chittorgarh, one of the BJP’s safe seats, in jeopardy. Purabia keeps telling his customers to vote based on ideology but not just them, even his brother refuses to listen to him. Ratanlal Kumawat, another committed BJP worker from the nearby village of Ghatiawali, expresses his frustration. “No one is thinking about the country … people are getting swayed by emotions.” But he also acknowledges Akya’s popularity.

After fielding Kumari from the Vidyadhar Nagar constituency, the BJP accommodated its three-term MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi, the son-in-law of former Vice-President, and ex-Rajasthan CM, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in Chittorgarh, which comes under the Lok Sabha constituency of state BJP president C P Joshi. After being denied his constituency in the first list, Rajvi had hit out at the party, calling the decision “shocking” and saying it was a “way to defame and hurt the legacy” of his father-in-law.

Rajvi is no stranger to Chittorgarh though. He won the elections from there in 1993 and 2003 before being moved to Jaipur in 2008. But that has not stopped Akya, who has won from Chittorgarh the last two terms, from making a “local vs outsider” pitch during campaigning. “I was denied a ticket because C P Joshi saw me as a threat to his political future. I am confident of winning as an Independent because people are with me for the work that I have done for them in the past 10 years,” he tells The Indian Express.

The rebel candidate has launched a whirlwind campaign. His supporters, many of them former BJP workers, go around town on jeeps, waving pressure cookers — his poll symbol — and shouting, “Phul, haath rehne do, cooker ki seeti bajne do (Don’t go for the lotus or the hand, let the cooker’s whistle make noise)”. At his public meetings, Akya is weighed in a balance against an equivalent amount of sweets and fruits, which are then distributed among people. “We are the real BJP,” claims his campaign manager Anil Inani.

Rajvi, however, says the rebel candidate is not a factor and people will vote for the party and him. “Akya will come third,” he claims.

The Congress, meanwhile, is hoping to benefit from this rift within the BJP. It has fielded two-term MLA Surendra Singh Jadawat, who won the constituency in 1998 and 2008. “Akya is going to cut BJP votes. We have committed Congress voters. That will help us win,” says a local Congress leader.

What people are saying

The constituency, famous for Chittorgarh Fort, is dominated by Rajputs and Brahmins, followed by the tribal community, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs). Akya’s support seems to cut across the caste divide.

Udai Lal who runs a milk parlour in the town, says he likes Akya because he is large-hearted. “I am a BJP supporter. I always vote for Modi. But what the BJP is doing is not good. You should not cut the tickets of good candidates. The idea of fielding MPs in Assembly polls will sink the BJP,” says Lal, a Brahmin.

Ratan Lal Singh, a Rajput who paints houses for a living, says this time the rebel will win. “He has done a lot for the youth and always stands by the people in need. Whenever anyone needs anything, he just opens his purse. Once people went to him saying the village was poor and had no utensils and he gave Rs 3 lakh from his pocket.”

Vishal Dhakad, who is from the OBC community, speaks with great excitement when asked about the elections. “All votes are going to Chandrabhan. Uska vyavahar hai logon se (He talks to people). You should have seen him going to file his nomination. More than 15,000 people turned up without being asked to. Go to his office and he will meet you with so much affection and respect. Ask him to get anything done and he immediately acts,” he says.

Mukul Saxena, a retired government servant in town, however, says he will continue to vote for the BJP. “The vote is for Modi. Gehlot is wearing a skull cap in public functions. If Hindus do not unite, we will be finished,” he adds.

In the constituency’s Adivasi belt, however, Congress appears to have sizeable support. “Everyone in our village votes for Congress. So we will vote for them again,” says Rameshlal, a Bhil from Gadri Khera village.",Political
Ashok Gehlot: ‘BJP is contesting Rajasthan LS style… poora dhawa bol rakha hai as they could not topple our govt’,"Aiming to buck the three-decade trend of alternating governments and hoping for his fourth term, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, 72, is leading the Congress party’s electioneering for the November 25 Assembly polls as it faces a formidable challenge from the Opposition BJP whose campaign is being spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Facing “anti-incumbency”, the Congress MLAs are banking on Gehlot’s welfare measures – and his face – to help them sail through, even as the CM has appealed to voters to see these elections as if he is contesting it on all 200 seats himself.

About 30 hours before the curtains come down on campaigning in the state and just before setting out to give one final push through another round of his whirlwind tours, Gehlot sits down at his residence in Jaipur for an interview with The Indian Express. Excerpts:

How many seats is the Congress going to win?

See, we have kept a target. Aayengi kitni ye samay batayega (How many seats we will get, only time will tell). In 1998, we won 156 seats when I was the PCC president. And now we have given a spectacular performance in Rajasthan, be it corona management, passing laws, and giving schemes or guarantees. An atmosphere of good governance has been created, so I said, “Mission 156”, and we are moving more and more towards it. Where we will stop, I can’t say.

There are many beneficiaries of various schemes but there is also uncertainty over the creation of a “beneficiary class”.

We are the one who give benefits. What the person taking the benefit thinks is up to him. We have left no stone unturned when it comes to performance. We have given a shandaar (excellent) performance and people are convinced of it. It is being discussed in villages and our schemes and benefits are reaching homes.

But the Rajasthan government’s debt to GSDP ratio has gone up to around 40%, which puts the state’s economy in a spot.

Without the permission of the Central government we can’t take loan of even Rs 1 lakh. And we are able to take loan on the basis of our performance and as per the set criteria. In terms of rate of our economic growth, which is 11.04%, we are first in North India and second among all the big states in the country, after Andhra Pradesh, where it is 11.4%.

When there was the BJP government in 2017, we were 30th in the country when it came to the per capita income. Today, we are 12th – that has been our achievement as Rajasthan’s per capita income has increased by 46.48%. And our dream is to become the first by 2030.

Then in 2020-21, our state GDP growth rate was 19.50%, the highest in a decade. In 2022, our food-grain production rate was double the national average at 8.10%. In the manufacturing sector, we were 12th during the BJP rule, now we are 7th. Due to people-friendly tax reforms, there was 24% increase in 2021-22 in revenue, the highest since 2013-14. So we have tried to share the benefits of a growing economy with the people.

BJP has no CM face this time around. Do you think it is benefiting the Congress?

It naturally helps. It is a Vidhan Sabha election, but you (BJP) are contesting it in Lok Sabha style. Central leaders are coming, there is PM Modi, Amit Shah ji, five Chief Ministers have come, 5-7 Union Ministers. Toh poora dhawa bol rakha hai Rajasthan pe (They have launched a full-scale offensive in Rajasthan) as they could not topple our government. So when they could not topple the government here while managing to topple governments in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and played foul in Goa and Manipur, toh sarkaar nahi girane ka dard chhipa hua hai inke dil ke andar (so the pain of not being able to topple the government is in their hearts) which keeps coming out time and again. Woh is liye dhawa bolte hain (Hence they’ve launched an offensive) on me, my family, PCC president and his family, and the government.

Ask them, is there anything lacking in our schemes? It is a state election and we worked for five years, so tell us our shortcomings. I challenge them to debate us on it.

In the last six months there have been raids on 51 locations by CBI, Income Tax, ED. Ask them, have you been able to pinpoint any politician or a bureaucrat (in connection with any case)?

You had said that the Congress will announce candidates two months in advance but there was a delay, and even then most sitting MLAs were repeated despite anti-incumbency. Why?

Option nahi hota (there is no option). First, the work is done for five years through MLAs, including in Panchayati Raj and Nagar Palika. And when the (local party) unit is set up, it is done through them. When everything is done through them, so naturally by the time elections come, woh he sab kuch hota hai wahan par (MLA becomes everything there). Although, this shouldn’t be the case. Ideally, (party) organisation should do organisation work and MLA should do MLA work. But unfortunately, the importance of an MLA increases in every political party. This time (in next government) we will try that MLA does MLA work and organisation does organisation work, this will be my thinking.

Apparently, there is unity between you and Sachin Pilot, but on the ground there still seems to be a lot of disagreement between your supporters.

I can’t say what kind of situation is in a particular area. But by and large we are trying to go into the campaign united.

Who will be the CM if the Congress returns to power?

I have said it many times that we have had a good tradition in the party – we pass a single line proposal. And high command also considers what the MLAs feel, what the common man thinks, and decides.

Priyanka Gandhi has been asking voters here not to be swayed by emotive issues while PM Modi accuses your government of “appeasement politics” and keeps mentioning Kanhaiya Lal’s murder.

They don’t have anything to say against us, hence they are doing politics to distract and are provoking people – when they shouldn’t. The kind of language Prime Minister is using, “press the button as if you are hanging (Congress)”. Ye kaunsi language hui (What kind of language is this)?

And Yogi ji (Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath) too employs such language for (conveying) other points. So the change in their language is a sign of their frustration. When you are staring at a loss, you are not as careful (with your words).

Why did Rahul Gandhi arrive so late for the Rajasthan campaign? He even went to Telangana before Rajasthan, though it votes after Rajasthan.

Mere pe vishwas tha unko (Rahul trusted me).

The BJP has made law and order an issue, especially crimes against women, while the Congress says that the numbers have increased mainly due to the mandatory registration of FIRs. Could this have been communicated better to the public?

The NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) figures are brought by the Central government and if you take it, Rajasthan is better than other states. We would want that it becomes even better. Incidents happen in every state but the immediate action, which happens here doesn’t happen anywhere else.

What is happening in UP? There is no rule of law. Rajasthan not only has a rule of law but the compulsory FIR has had a huge impact. The court ordered cases through CrPC section 156 (3) are not even around 10% now as FIRs are being lodged now. This is a living example before us.

Who is Sourav Ganguly batting for now? Kolkata back to an old game,"AS BATSMAN, skipper, BCCI president or commentator, Sourav Ganguly thrived on unfriendly pitches. The presumed Prince of Kolkata’s presumptive political project, however, is taking longer to find its feet – with the latest development putting him in Team Trinamool Congress.

On Tuesday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee named Ganguly as the state’s Brand Ambassador, replacing megastar Shah Rukh Khan. The announcement, at the TMC government’s Global Business Summit gala, came two months after Ganguly accompanied the CM on a rare foreign visit by her, as a precursor to the summit and to draw investment to Bengal.

And it came just over a year after a reluctant Ganguly was replaced as BCCI president with Roger Binny, in an organisation where the shots are seen as called by Secretary Jay Shah, the son of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Advertisement

Go further back, to before the 2021 Assembly polls, and Ganguly was seen as not just in the BJP camp but also a possible CM face of the party. The BJP’s high-decibel campaign had talked up the party’s chances in the elections, though these were swept by the TMC eventually.

The rumours of Ganguly’s proximity to the BJP top brass at the time had grown after photographs emerged of him hosting Shah along with senior state BJP leaders Suvendu Adhikari and Sukanta Majumder for a meal at his home.

Days later though, Ganguly was by the side of Mamata at the State Secretariat. In September 2022, he shared the stage with her at a thanksgiving ceremony after Bengal got the UNESCO heritage tag for Durga Puja.

But it was the end of Ganguly’s BCCI tenure in October 2022 that was the firmest hint that the bonhomie between the cricketer and BJP may have ended.

After his appointment as Bengal brand ambassador Tuesday, BJP leaders openly speculated that Mamata had made her move for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls by co-opting arguably Bengal’s biggest sporting star.

Addressing Ganguly, who was seated on the dais, the CM said at the business summit: “He is a very popular figure and comes from a younger generation. I want to inform him that he is now the brand ambassador of Bengal. I will request him to accept this… You can’t say no.”

The former India cricket captain had earlier been as full of praise for the CM in his speech at the programme. “I say this genuinely, whenever I send her (Mamata) an SMS, I get a response within a minute. Rarely is there a delay. Whenever she watches me on television, she sends an SMS, asking how I am and whether I have eaten. I am so touched with the care and affection you have shown me,” Ganguly said.

Asked about what he thought of their exchange, BJP national vice-president and former Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh said Wednesday: “It has taken so long for the Bengal government and TMC to give recognition to Sourav Ganguly… He has done so much for Bengal and Bengal cricket. (Now) Keeping the 2024 (Lok Sabha polls) in mind, she (Mamata) wants to hold Sourav’s hand… She wants to use him for 2024… Shah Rukh Khan’s market is down.”

The BJP, in contrast, has always acknowledged Ganguly’s role as an “icon”, Ghosh said. “He was given the honour of brand ambassador by Tripura (a BJP-ruled state) much before… The BJP made him BCCI president. The BJP used him in cricket, not politics.”

TMC leader Jay Prakash Majumder told The Indian Express that the BJP’s reaction again showed that “anything concerning the development of Bengal, benefit of Bengal makes the BJP, especially the Bengal BJP, unhappy”. “The poor are suffering because of the economic blockade by the Centre (referring to the Centre blocking state funds for some schemes over alleged irregularities). Sourav Ganguly, the pride of Bengal, whose face is known to the world and not just India, is made the brand ambassador of the state. And the BJP says, ‘why so late’ or ‘why Sourav’. This shows the lack of value-based politics by the BJP.”

About whether the Ganguly-Mamata warmth hinted that he was ready for his long-awaited political plunge, Ghosh said: “It is for Ganguly to decide whether he will join politics or not.”

A senior TMC leader said: “The CPI(M) first tried to rope him in. A few years back, the BJP tried to rope him in. Now, it is a great move by Mamata Banerjee to make him the brand ambassador. Who knows what will happen next? It all depends on Ganguly.”

Before the 2021 Assembly polls, he was said to have declined a BJP proposal for direct entry into politics.

After his visit to Spain and the UAE in Spain in September, Ganguly insisted to mediapersons that he has no political affiliations. “I am an individual, I am not an MLA, MP. I don’t have any political attachment. I get invited across the world, Spain, Kolkata, Delhi. I am not answerable to anybody. We are humans and we interact with people,” he said.

However, as Ganguly hangs around Bengal’s political circles, the rumours – which have now been around for 17 years – are hardly likely to die down soon.

Back then, in 2006, when he was two years from retirement and still trying to make a comeback to the national team, Ganguly had denied any plans to campaign for the CPI(M), then the long-running ruling party of Bengal.",Political
"As Telangana sentiment wanes, other issues bubble up, as do Congress hopes","The battle for Telangana is winding down to a contest of promises, with just about a week left for polling now. While the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR is showcasing the state government’s welfare schemes, the Congress is projecting a slew of similar schemes it is pledging if voted to power.

Across large swathes of the erstwhile undivided districts of Nalgonda and Mahbubnagar, the Congress appears to have a fresh energy in its ranks.

In the Assembly elections held in 2014 to a united Andhra Pradesh (Telangana was carved out soon after), the then incumbent Congress, despite a pro-BRS (BRS was formerly called Telangana Rashtra Samithi) wave, had got 25.20% of the votes, against the BRS’s 34% in the Telangana area.

In 2018 (when the elections were brought forward by the BRS government), both parties had seen a rise, to 28.70% for the Congress and 47% for the BRS. In terms of seats, it worked out to 63 and 88 seats out of 119 for the BRS, and 21 and 19 seats for the Congress, in 2014 and 2018 respectively.

The rise in BRS votes was attributed to the pro-Telangana state sentiment, as the party was widely perceived to be one of its key architects.

But that sentiment seems to have waned now. Very few people talk about the sacrifices that people, especially youth, made for the cause of Telangana statehood. Their concerns have instead shifted to issues like welfare schemes, government jobs, development, and civic infrastructure — and, evidently, the Congress.

Whether this perceived surge in people’s interest in the Congress will translate into votes come November 30 remains to be seen. And Telangana Congress chief A Revanth Reddy, who is spearheading the party’s campaign, is mindful of this, cautioning his party candidates not to get carried away by “hype” or depend too much on “surveys”. “Campaign hard, be in touch with the people and take advantage of the mood,” he told them at Nagarkurnool Tuesday.

In Nalgonda district, the Congress hopes rest on the Komatireddy brothers, Venkat Reddy and Raj Gopal, with the party celebrating his return from the BJP. The two brothers, together with their immense financial muscle, have thrown in their weight behind all the party candidates in this region.

In the 2014 polls, in the undivided Nalgonda district with 12 Assembly seats, the BRS had won 6 seats as compared to the Congress’s 5. In the 2018 polls, the BRS won 9 seats as against the Congress’s 3, which included the Nakrekal, Huzurnagar, and Munugode seats. The Congress later lost the Huzurnagar and Munugode seats to the BRS in the bypolls.

“Government schemes are here to stay, whatever be the party. The question is who will give more and from which party’s government more benefits will accrue. Voters are very wise these days,” N Vidyasagar, a student, says at Nakrekal.

At Cheruvugattu in the area, Pravin Chari, a diploma civil engineer, who calls himself a BRS supporter, is also sceptical of the ruling party’s chances. “Youth are a bit disappointed over lack of government jobs. I think that factor and the feeling that has settled among people that only pro-BRS beneficiaries have taken advantage, will result in tough contests all over Nalgonda,” he says.

At Deverkonda, former Communist Sarpanch M Ramesh Reddy says that the Komatireddy brothers are ensuring a “tough fight” between the BRS and Congress. “If the BRS has to win, all the beneficiaries have to vote for it,” he says.

The contest between the parties has now started coalescing around the “Indiramma rajyam (rule of ex-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi)” issue. At Nagarkurnool, a raucous crowd egged him on as Revanth countered KCR’s claims that the ex-PM’s tenure was marked by starvation, Naxal rise and fake encounters.

In the 2014 polls, in the erstwhile undivided Mahbubnagar district with 14 seats, the BRS had won 7 seats as against the Congress’s 5. In 2018, the BRS made a clean sweep in the region, bagging 13 seats while the Congress could get just 1 seat.

Congress stalwart Revanth Reddy is now contesting from the Kodangal seat here, while Jupally Krishna Rao, who quit the BRS to join the Congress, is another prominent contender from the district.

Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy and K Jana Reddy are also leading the party’s campaign in the region.

The Congress attempt to match the BRS in promises notwithstanding, sitting BRS Nalgonda MLA K Bhupal Reddy says the KCR government’s scheme legacy will result in a third straight win. “At least 70% of the beneficiaries will vote for the BRS,” says Bhupal Reddy.

In Alair, Jadcherla and Shadnagar areas, many supporters of the late Y S Rajshekar Reddy, the Congress leader who controlled the reins in united Andhra before his death, who had moved to the BRS in the 2014 and 2018 polls, also seem to be disgruntled this time.

Some of them say they participated in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra last year when it traversed the state.

Government jobs are a big issue among the youth here, says Narendra Goud, a Group 1 job aspirant. “And they feel the BRS has let them down. A majority of them attended Group 1 and 2 coaching classes at Hyderabad, but returned home disappointed.”

The BRS enjoys strong support from some BC (backward class) groups, especially occupation-based castes like Golla Kuruma to whom the BRS government has provided sheep in large numbers in Nalgonda and Mahbubnagar districts.

In Warangal district, it seems to be a tight contest between the BRS and Congress. “People love KCR, but I guess that after nine years, there is anti-incumbency. It depends on whether BRS schemes stand it in good stead or not. Farmers who receive Rythu Bandhu without fail may stick to KCR, but the Congress has promised to increase the amount soon after coming to power,” points out K Maheshwar Reddy, a farmer from Parkal.",Political
Karnataka Congress govt may not bite the bullet as Dalit ministers raise internal quota demand,"The Karnataka Congress government appears to have decided to put the ball in the Centre’s court over the implementation of the 2012 report of the Justice A J Sadashiva Commission. Dalit leaders in the state Congress have been demanding that the government accept the report and provide “internal quotas” to Dalits.

The Commission had been set up by a Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) government in 2005, to look into the need for classifying Karnataka’s Scheduled Castes into sub categories for the purposes of reservations, and to find ways of doing it.

According to sources, the government has taken this position because the report had already been “partially accepted” by the previous BJP government. “The Justice Sadashiva Commission report is not up for consideration. The previous government had accepted parts of it and had already written to the Centre to clear a path for the implementation of internal quotas. The issue is now before the Centre,” said officials in the state Law Ministry.

There is fresh urgency after November 11, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a poll rally in neighbouring Telangana that he would constitute a committee to look into the demand for internal reservations for Dalits, made by the Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti (MRPS) in that state.

Soon after, three Dalit Karnataka ministers — Home Minister G Parameshwara, Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa and Food and Civil Supplies Minister K H Muniyappa — along with seven-time Congress Lok Sabha MP K H Muniyappa, requested Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to accept the report.

In fact, Muniyappa, who belongs to the Madiga community — considered the most deprived among Dalits — has given a call to all Madigas to stage statewide protests demanding the implementation of the report. Two weeks ago, he had asked the community to stick to their demand for the implementation of the report in the state.

The Madigas are the largest block of Dalits. They feel aggrieved by better-off sub-groups hogging most of the Dalit quotas, and consider the Sadashiva report to be key to the delivery of social justice, because it studied the socio-economic conditions of Dalits as sub groups.

“In our SC/ST convention before the state polls, we adopted a declaration, one of whose points was the promise to table the Sadashiva Commission report in the first Assembly session itself,” said Home Minister G Parameshwara, who belongs to a smaller but better-off sub-group of Dalits called Holeyas.

Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa, who is also a Holeya, however, believes the Sadashiva report needs to be considered, but only within the framework of the Constitution, and through consultations with the Law Department.

Law department officials, however, are of the view that the implementation of the report is now the prerogative of the Centre, since the previous outgoing BJP government had partially accepted it and recommended internal quotas through a Cabinet sub-committee that studied the report.

“The Justice Sadashiva Commission report was accepted by the previous BJP government and placed before a Cabinet sub-committee headed by the then law minister. After the sub-committee modified the recommendations, they were accepted by the government,” said sources in the state law department.

The Sadashiva Commission findings

Among the essential findings of the Sadashiva Commission, which were publicised through a press release in 2012, is that Madigas (SC Left), who are considered untouchable in the caste hierarchy, are more socially backward than the ‘SC Right’ groups like Holeyas, who are considered more acceptable in society.

The commission also found that most of the existing 15% quota for 101 Dalit sub-groups was being cornered by the SC Right groups like Holeyas and new SC groups like the Bhovis and the Lambanis, while the most backward Madigas continued to be deprived.

The report also indicated that while Holeyas and Madigas made up nearly a third each of the SC population in Karnataka, the Madiga numbers were about 2% higher than that of the Holeyas.

The BJP had promised to implement internal reservations before the 2018 Assembly polls. In power, however, the BJP government then led by CM Basavaraj Bommai rejected the Justice Sadashiva Commission report, but said it could implement some recommendations made by the Cabinet sub-committee set up to study the report. The government ended up allotting 6% quotas to the SC Left (including Madigas, as suggested by the report), 5.5% to the SC Right (Holeyas), 4.5% to the touchables (Bhovis and Lambanis), and 1% to other Dalits.

Before accepting the recommendations of the sub-committee, the Bommai government increased the overall quota for SCs in the state from 15% to 17%. Since this raised the combined SC-ST quota by 6% — taking total reservations in the state to 56% (OBCs 32%, SCs 17%, STs 7%), ie., above the 50% ceiling fixed by the SC in the 1992 Indira Sawhney judgment — the Bommai government asked the Centre to incorporate the changes into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, to prevent these from being overturned by courts.

The poll boomerang

Eventually, the Karnataka BJP’s move to hike the reservation quota of SCs and STs before the Assembly elections in May had not paid off. While the party failed to secure a single ST-reserved seat — it had won seven last time — its tally of SC-reserved seats dropped from 16 in 2018 to 12.

In contrast, the Congress won 21 of the 36 SC-reserved seats (up from 12 in 2018) and swept the ST seats by winning 14 out of 15 (up from 7 in 2018), with one going to the JD(S).",Political
"Decoding Politics: Why is BJP raising two ‘comments’, one by Gehlot loyalist, another by his son?","Poll-bound Rajasthan’s political discourse seems to be revolving around two key issues. Firstly, a comment by state Cabinet minister and Ashok Gehlot loyalist Shanti Dhariwal, which allegedly insulted the women of the state.

Another issue that has grabbed the limelight is an alleged remark by Chief Minister Gehlot’s son Vaibhav, that the Congress government led by his father will not come back to power.

So, how have the two issues become a frequent feature of the political discourse in Rajasthan?

Dhariwal’s statement and the subsequent row

On March 9 last year, a day after International Women’s Day, Dhariwal during an address in the Assembly said the high number of rapes in Rajasthan were due to it ‘‘being a men’s state’’.

Replying during a debate on grants to the police and jails of the state, Dhariwal, who is also the Minister for Law and Legal Affairs, said, “We are number one in rape. Isme koi do raai nahi. Ab ye rape ke mamle mein kyu hai, kahin na kahin galti hai ye toh s**** (Why we are number one in rapes, there is a fault somewhere).”

As a few MLAs behind him began speaking, Dhariwal turned around and said, “Rajasthan toh mardon ka pradesh raha hai. Ab uska kya kare? (Rajasthan has been a state of men. What can be done?)” The MLAs then burst into laughter.

However, no protests were held in the Assembly over the remarks as the Opposition BJP had staged a walkout before the minister’s address. However, later in the day, BJP state president Satish Poonia slammed Dhariwal’s comments and termed his “shameless confession of the state being number one in rapes” an insult to the women.

“The remarks have also lowered the dignity of men. If the Congress has any morality left, such a minister should be sacked,” he had said.

The National Commission for Women (NCW) had also taken suo moto cognizance of Dhariwal’s comments while the BJP created an uproar over them in the Assembly the following day.

Dhariwal subsequently apologised and said his remarks were the result of a “slip of tongue”.

The minister’s candidature for the polls hung in the balance with the Congress high command reportedly against it for his role in organising a separate meeting of MLAs loyal to Gehlot while skipping an official Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting last year. Eventually, he was fielded by the party from Kota North, which he represents in the current Assembly.

The BJP has now dug up the year-old issue to slam the Congress. At a rally in Bharatpur last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Dhariwal without naming him.

“The Congress has rewarded this minister with a ticket instead of punishing him. Even people in Delhi (Congress high command) agreed to give him a ticket. This raises a question of what “second red diary” is in the possession of jaadugar’s (Gehlot) favourite minister that even Delhi had to bow down to him. Every Congress leader knows the minister’s truth, yet they gave him a ticket as he has information about people in Delhi. After the BJP forms the government here, I promise to unravel that secret too,” Modi had said.

This brings us to the question of what the “first red diary” is.

The first red diary and Vaibhav’s statement

The “red diary” first hogged the limelight in July after former minister of state Rajendra Singh Gudha claimed he was sent by the CM to retrieve the diary from the house of Gehlot’s close aide Dharmendra Rathore, whose house was being raided by central agencies amid a political crisis in 2020.

Gudha’s claims came after he was sacked as minister by Gehlot, hours after he had slammed the state government in the House over the rise in crimes against women. The former MoS had urged his government to introspect on this, rather than speak on the violence in Manipur.

Since his unceremonious exit, Gudha has been raking up the red diary while claiming that the CM has been regularly asking him whether he had burnt it. The former minister also claimed that Gehlot would be behind bars had he not retrieved the diary.

Gudha has now joined the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde) and will be in the fray from Udaipurwati constituency, which he won in 2018 as a BSP candidate.

Last week too, the Udaipurwati MLA raked up the issue when he showed some pages of the purported diary to the media. “Vaibhav Gehlot says this government will not come back to power. I can give it in writing that my father cannot come back to power. Rajendra Gudha is not saying this. This is being said by Vaibhav Gehlot, the chief minister’s son,” the Udaipurwati MLA said while flaunting pages of the “red diary”, though there is no confirmation of Vaibhav having said this.

The BJP and Modi have targeted Gehlot over the diary. “Some people say that there is a quboolnama (confession) of a son in the red diary, where he says his papa’s government will not come back to power,” Modi said at a recent rally.

Modi raked up the issue again at a public meeting in Nagaur. “Gehlot ji, kya ho gaya? Aapka jaadu aapke bete par bhi nahi chal raha hai kya (What happened Gehlotji? Is your magic not working on your own son)?” he had said.",Political
Today in Politics: PM Modi to chair virtual G20 summit; Amit Shah steps up Rajasthan campaign,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a virtual summit of G20 leaders on Wednesday evening, to discuss the implementation of the Delhi Declaration adopted in September and several new challenges that have emerged since then.

Addressing a press conference in Delhi on the eve of the summit, India’s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant said the deliberations will witness “excellent participation” from leaders of the grouping.

China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin had skipped the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10. However, the Russian Tass news agency, quoting a Kremlin statement, has confirmed that Putin will take part in the extraordinary virtual G20 summit on Wednesday, adding that the Russian President had to miss the Delhi summit in September and the Bali summit in November, 2022, as he had to focus on the “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Kant described the virtual summit as “rare and exceptional” which would give Modi an opportunity to interact with the world leaders for a second time during India’s G20 Presidency before it passes on to Brazil in December.

The virtual meeting of G20 leaders is taking place a day after leaders of the BRICS grouping held an extraordinary meeting on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

On the domestic politics front, with just two days left for campaigning for the November 25 Rajasthan Assembly elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah will continue his campaigning in the state on Wednesday, addressing rallies in Pali, Jalore and Sanchore districts.

The Rajasthan poll campaigning turned more bitter after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Tuesday referred to PM Modi as a “panauti (harbinger of bad luck)”, linking his presence in the stadium to India’s loss against Australia at the ICC World Cup finals in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

This came a week after Modi had called Rahul “moorkhon ka sardaar” (leader of fools), responding to the latter’s statement that everybody in India has only Chinese mobile handsets.

The BJP reacted sharply, accusing Rahul of using abusive language against the Prime Minister because of the frustration of electoral losses. Read more in Vikas Pathak’s report, here.

The Congress Tuesday announced its Rajasthan manifesto, promising a law to ensure MSP for crops, doubling the insurance sum under the flagship Chiranjeevi health insurance from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, 10 lakh jobs in the next five years, including 4 lakh government jobs, as well as CCTV cameras in public places for the safety of women.

The incumbent party’s other promises include bringing the Vidhan Parishad to Rajasthan “for wider participation”, “stringent legal measures for hate speech”, and constitution of “reconciliation and camaraderie committees at the district level to address hatred and enmity between communities”.

In Punjab, with alliance talks between ex-allies, the BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), on the backburner, the BJP is banking on Central schemes targeted at the state to entice the rural poor, while attacking the ruling AAP for “hijacking” such schemes. Meanwhile, the Akalis are turning to the state’s youth, offering them pathways up the political ladder via their new membership drive. Read Navjeevan Gopal’s report, here.

Announcing the Samajwadi Party (SP)’s programme to pay tributes to the party’s founder, late Mulayam Singh Yadav, on his birth anniversary Wednesday, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said that after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, there will be a “big change” in the country and samajwadis will play an important role in it.

“After 2024, there will be a different kind of a change in the country, and samajwadis will play an important role in it. The SP’s PDA Yatra has sent a strong message. The PDA will compete with the BJP and the NDA,” Akhilesh said, during his Picchde, Dalit, Alpsankhyak (Backward, Dalit and Minority) rally in Lucknow.

“Seeing the strength of the PDA, many parties are now supporting caste census. Even parties which had earlier stopped this, have now come in favour of caste census,” he said.

The SP president said the caste census has been a longstanding demand for his party because it is crucial for social justice. “The first thing SP will do after coming to power is to conduct a caste census,” he added.

In Mumbai, Shiv Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Parab said the cross-examination of Shiv Sena (UBT) chief whip Sunil Prabhu, which began on Tuesday, will continue on Wednesday. Prabhu is being cross-examined by lawyers of the Shiv Sena (Shinde) in the case related to the disqualification of MLAs of the undivided Shiv Sena.

“Cross examination of Sunil Prabhu took place today. He gave appropriate answers to all the questions,” Parab said, adding that Prabhu had demanded that his statement be recorded in Marathi, and sought an official translator who could record it, after alleging that it was not being done correctly.

“We felt that many questions were not needed and there was a delaying tactic. They have to give judgment by December 31. There is a possibility that they could seek further time and we don’t want to give that,” Parab added.

On September 18, the Supreme Court had directed Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to give the judgment on disqualification of rebel Sena MLAs by December 31, coming down hard on him over the delay in deciding the disqualification pleas filed by both Sena factions against each other.

In Kerala, the LDF government’s outreach programme, “Nava Kerala Sadas”, will continue through Kannur district on Wednesday, when CM Pinarayi Vijayan will chair a Cabinet meeting at Thalassery.

On Tuesday, Vijayan claimed the workers of the CPI(M) youth wing DYFI had saved the lives of some Youth Congress (YC) activists who had allegedly tried to jump in front of the CM’s cavalcade, waving black flags. He added that they had not been assaulted, as reported.

The Congress contested the CM’s statement, claiming that the CPI(M) and DYFI workers had carried out brutal violence against Congress student wing Kerala Students Union (KSU) and YC activists.

Earlier in the day, Vijayan, at a press briefing in Kannur, had said he was sitting in the front seat of the bus on which he and his Cabinet colleagues were travelling as part of the sadas, and saw the YC activists trying to jump in front of the vehicle.

“It happened right in front of my eyes. The DYFI workers were trying to prevent them from jumping in front of the oncoming vehicle. They were saving the lives of the YC activists, for which some force had to be used. It was not an assault,” the CM said.

Rajasthan polls | ‘Will teach Congress a lesson’: The Sachin Pilot impasse may cost party in Gujjar belt,"THE CONGRESS has survived a narrow win, one mutiny and one quieter rebellion in the last five years to stay in power in Rajasthan – all the while dogged by the Sachin Pilot question. Now, the BJP is cashing in.

In 2018, the Gujjar community had rallied behind Pilot, electing 8 Gujjar MLAs from the Congress and none from the BJP. The BJP and Congress are matched in tickets to Gujjar candidates this time – 10 and 11, respectively – and the BJP is banking on the community favouring it, especially in eastern Rajasthan, where Pilot’s influence goes well beyond the Gujjar community.

The BJP has been working on the plan for long. This January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a programme to commemorate the 1,111th ‘Avataran Mahotsav’ of Gujjar deity Devnarayan in Bhilwara.

Former BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje was not present. It was under her term that over 70 Gujjars were killed during a violent reservation agitation.

“The party has been trying to approach the community with a clean slate, and it will show in the results,” a BJP leader says.

The ‘betrayal’

The BJP’s confidence is reflected on the ground. In Mitrpura in Dausa district – Pilot used to be an MP from this Gujjar-dominated seat, as were his parents Rajesh and Rama – three men of a Gujjar family slam the Congress’s “beizzati (insult)” of Pilot, after the 2018 party win was attributed to a large extent to his efforts as party president.

Sumer Singh Gurjar, 52, says: “We voted for the Congress with tann, mann, dhan (wholeheartedly). Par daga kar diya Pilot ke saath (But they cheated Pilot).”

The support for Pilot had also carried several Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste candidates of the Congress past the winning mark in 2018, despite the Meenas (who are STs) and Gujjars being considered traditional caste rivals.

Sumer says the community continues to back Gajraj Khatana and Murari Lal Meena, but there are doubts over Gujjar support for Congress sitting ministers Parsadi Lal Meena, Mamta Bhupesh (SC) and MLA O P Hudla (ST), among others.

The Gujjar-Meena bonhomie, or what’s left of it, was further strained by Parsadi Lal’s remark recently, saying: “Sachin Pilot, Rajesh Pilot ko humne he panpaya hai (have thrived due to us). No one knew them before 1984. I was the lone Meena leader who was with them and supported whoever the party asked us to – be it Sachin, Rajesh or Rama Pilot.”

In September, Congress MLA from Sawai Madhopur and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s adviser Danish Abrar faced the brunt of the anger over the Pilot issue in his own constituency. Considered a Pilot loyalist, he had sided with Gehlot during Pilot’s 2020 rebellion, when the then deputy CM and 18 other MLAs had parked themselves in hotels in BJP-ruled Haryana, ultimately failing to get enough numbers to break away.

Visiting Sawai Madhopur for a programme to honour Gujjar deity Devnarayan, Abrar had been met with slogans of “Pilot ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro s*****n ko (Shoot those who betrayed Pilot).”

The same month, a vehicle in which Niwai MLA Prashant Bairwa was travelling came under attack. Like Abrar, Bairwa too was considered close to Pilot but did not join him in the rebellion.

In Dausa’s Kherli village, father-son duo Nihal Singh Gurjar and Ajay Singh, 26, say the Congress would have benefited had it implemented a formula of 2.5-years each for Gehlot and Pilot as CM. The high command’s efforts in this regard were constantly thwarted by Gehlot. Last year, Gehlot loyalists even stayed out of a CLP meeting which was understood to have been called by Delhi to pick Pilot as CM.

Nihal says they won’t vote for Bhupesh this time even if Pilot himself canvasses for the minister. The unhappiness with Minister Bhupesh, the MLA from Sikrai, is only partly it; Nihal wants to teach the Congress a “lesson” for Pilot being openly called “naakara nikamma”, as Gehlot has done more than once.

There is another factor behind the winds of change in the Gujjar belt. The son of Gujjar reservation agitation architect Kirori Singh Bainsla, Vijay Bainsla, is a BJP candidate from Deoli Uniara Assembly seat, part of Tonk district adjoining Dausa.

Tonk’s Muslim ‘anger’

In Tonk, Pilot’s own Assembly constituency – where they are the largest group among 2.5 lakh voters – the Muslims are also angry with the Congress government, their despair arising from its “silence” on issues affecting the community. However, they are largely forgiving of Pilot.

This August, during a visit to Tonk, Pilot was accosted by Mohsin Rasheed, the Rajasthan coordinator of the Congress minority cell, who asked why he hadn’t spoken up on the Nasir-Junaid case, referring to the killing of two Muslim youths by “cow vigilantes”.

He also questioned Pilot over the Congress favouring approaching the Supreme Court against the High Court’s acquittal of the Jaipur bomb blast accused, the suggestion being that they were not innocent. Pilot admonished him for “spreading galatfehmi (falsehoods)”.

When the elections came around, Rasheed, 42, who has a significant following on social media, threw his hat into the ring. He later withdrew, on the counsel of “the community’s elders” and after assurances by the Pilot camp, he says.

Rasheed still talks about Pilot’s muted response on issues affecting the community, including a recent statement by BJP Tonk district in-charge and controversial leader Ramesh Bidhuri that “Lahore is watching the Tonk polls”.

However, out in the streets of Tonk, the general – and generous – view is that Pilot can’t afford to take a pro-Muslim stand and turn Hindus away.

“Bidhuri has been sent to provoke tensions and if Pilot speaks, he might lose their (Hindu) votes,” says Anwar, 32, who runs a recycling shop in Tonk’s Kafila market, while adding that vote for Pilot is their “majboori (helplessness)”.

Among a group at a tea-stall nearby, Arif, 45, says Muslims have no option other than the Congress. “Where else will we go?”

After Muslims, the biggest chunk of voters in Tonk are SCs, followed by Gujjars, and then Jats, STs and upper castes. While Pilot’s candidature makes it a safe seat for the Congress now, it has voted almost equally for the party and BJP since the BJP was formed in 1980 – with the BJP winning in 1980, 1990, 1993, 2003 and 2013; and the Congress in 1985, 1998, 2008 and 2018.

Last time, Pilot won by over 54,000 votes against the BJP’s Yunus Khan, an influential leader displaced from his traditional bastion.

While Pilot is expected to win again, if not as comfortably, even staunch Gujjar supporters believe the government may be changing in Jaipur. One of them, Ram Gurjar, says the Congress should make amends and name Pilot as at least the Leader of the Opposition or the party state president, if the BJP wins.

BJP candidate Ajit Singh Mehta, who won from Tonk in 2013, calls Pilot “an outsider”, who has “undone all the work done during my tenure”. “Pilot doesn’t know which village has water or electricity issues, or about the missing compounders and doctors at PHCs and CHCs.”

He talks of pulling off an upset like senior BJP leader Smriti Irani did in Amethi, defeating Rahul Gandhi from the family bastion in 2019. “Today, kings are not born in wombs… it is the people who decide,” Mehta says. “Pilot was the CM face in 2018, but this time the CM (Gehlot) has said the chair won’t leave him. So Pilot is contesting an MLA election, and so am I.”

And then he brings up that ‘R’ word, saying people remember that Pilot is a leader who rebelled against his party.

Back in Kafila, at another tea-stall, Abdul Raees, 63, says: “No party really helps us, but we want the Congress to come to power… We just want to live peacefully, that’s the only issue for us in Tonk.”",Political
"Ex-CJ defends rap on EC: if it’s seen tilting, it matters in a democracy","Acknowledging the need for judicial restraint, Justice Sanjib Banerjee underlined that the Election Commission’s conduct can have “great consequences” for democracy as he defended his 2021 observations, as former Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, that “murder charges” should be imposed on the poll panel for violating Covid protocols during Tamil Nadu Assembly elections.

“A judge should certainly be restrained. However, the Election Commission is an institution which has a great responsibility. So, if it is seen tilting, one way or the other, by even a very small degree, it can have great consequences for democracy,” he told The Indian Express days after he retired as Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court.

After an 11-month stint as Chief Justice of Madras High Court, Justice Banerjee was transferred as Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court. He retired on November 1.

“The case was being heard (in Madras HC) for a while and I felt there were some aberrations which is why those observations were made. Crowding in rallies and not following Covid protocol was certainly a concern and when the elections in West Bengal was held an eight phases, why was it held in a single phase in Tamil Nadu? You have to look at it in that context and not pick just two sentences,” Justice Banerjee said.

“Also, one cannot say that the court can’t make any observations. Lawyers cannot be expected to argue with a wall. They have to get indications from the bench so they can tailor their case accordingly,” he said.

The EC had moved the Supreme Court against these observations, terming them “uncalled for, blatantly disparaging and derogatory.”

While the SC refused to expunge the observation or bar the media from reporting it, Justice Banerjee‘s observations were widely discussed in legal circles when he was suddenly transferred to Meghalaya, one of the smallest High Courts.

When asked if he knew the reasons behind his unusual transfer, Justice Banerjee said that he is not concerned with the reason.

“I am sure there were cogent reasons for my transfer but I am not aware of it. I received an email (from then CJI NV Ramana’s office) and I said yes. Once you become a judge, you cannot have any ambitions of holding a particular office. So there was no question of me not consenting to the transfer,” he said.

A statement published by the Collegium on November 9, 2021 said that “the Supreme Court collegium in its meeting held on 16th September, 2021, has recommended the transfer of Mr Justice, Sanjiv, Banerji, Chief Justice, Madras High Court to Meghalaya High Court.”

Advertisement

While the statement cited no reason, Justice Banerjee said that the email only indicated that the transfer would be in the “interest of better administration of justice.”

Justice Banerjee added: “But I would not have had it any other way. The work that happened in Meghalaya during my stint was very important. In my 11 months in Madras, I had very rewarding judicial work. But in Meghalaya, there wasn’t a lot of judicial work but we focused on infrastructure building.”

On his stint in Madras, Justice Banerjee said that he was far from wanting to maintain the status quo and actively handled things in Madras High Court.

“While the idea is that a Chief Justice who comes from outside takes a dispassionate view when it comes to appointments or other aspects, there is a flip side that they could end up being status quo-ists without wanting to ruffle too many feathers. By and large, the office of Chief Justice is considered a stepping stone for Supreme Court judgeship. It is to be somewhere but look elsewhere and not take steps to actively address the uncle judge syndrome when it comes to appointments,” he said.

As a High Court judge for nearly two decades, he said, corruption in the higher judiciary worries him.

“Punitive transfers are not enough. Corruption is an unimpeachable offence but it is difficult to gather evidence. These activities are not done in broad daylight but it is possible to collect some evidence of corruption. However, impeachment is a political solution. A compromised judge is convenient for all political parties. This is an aspect which erodes faith in the system and needs to be tackled,” he said.",Political
"In last leg of polls, Rahul Gandhi calls PM Modi ‘panauti’; BJP demands apology","The campaign during the ongoing Assembly elections turned more bitter with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Tuesday referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a panauti (harbinger of bad luck), linking his presence to India’s loss against Australia at the World Cup finals in Ahmedabad two days ago.

The BJP reacted sharply, accusing Gandhi of using abusive language against the Prime Minister because of the frustration of electoral losses.

“Panauti… panauti… Achha bhalaa hamare ladke wahaan World Cup jeetne waale the, par panauti harwaa diya. TV waale ye nahin kahenge magar janta jaanti hai (Our boys were going to win the World Cup, but panauti got them defeated. TV channels will not say this but the public knows),” Gandhi said at a public rally in Balotra, Rajasthan.

Just a week ago, Modi had called Rahul moorkhon ka sardaar (leader of fools) after Rahul said everybody in India has only Chinese mobile handsets. “Congress leaders suffer a mental disease of not acknowledging India’s achievements,” Modi had said in Madhya Pradesh, and said India had taken rapid strides in mobile manufacturing.

Earlier this year, Rahul Gandhi was briefly disqualified as a Member of Parliament after a Surat court handed him a two-year sentence for his remark on the surname Modi. He was reinstated only after the Supreme Court stayed the sentence.

Demanding an apology from Gandhi for his latest remark, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “What has happened to you, Rahul Gandhi? You are so troubled because of the frustration of losses that you are using abusive language against the Prime Minister of the country. Our Prime Minister loves our players and goes to boost their morale and to help them. The Bharatiya team is doing well in Asiads, Olympics and paralympics. Our players played very well. It’s all right – defeat and victory happen. Rahul Gandhi must apologise.”

KC Venugopal of the Congress, however, defended Gandhi’s jibe. “Rahul ji has said what many have been thinking since 2 days! The World Cup finals was a moment of pride for 140 crore Indians and we were all looking forward to this historic occasion, but they were desperate to hijack it for their political mileage. The BJP should be the last ones to talk about political correctness. These Godse bhakts, including PM Modi, who have regularly insulted Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi ji, Sonia ji and Rahul ji with the most vile abuses are finding it difficult to digest the hard truth,” Venugopal wrote on social media platform X.

Roznama Rashtriya Sahara

Commenting on Australia’s win over India in the final of the ICC men’s cricket world cup, the multi-edition Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, in its leader titled, “Team India: match hara, dil jeeta (Team India: match lost, hearts won)”, writes that victory and loss are part of any game, which cannot be reduced to just the bare bones of results. It would not be fair to look at the performance of any sportsperson or team through the narrow prism of the outcome, because while taking to the field no one wants to put in less than their best efforts, the editorial says. “And this is also not necessary that the team which has been performing well consistently and appears invincible will never face a setback. In the cricket World Cup, for instance, the Indian team displayed excellent performance throughout the tournament, proving itself to be the world’s best team (before it was felled by the Aussies).”

The daily highlights the accomplishments of Virat Kohli, who notched up maximum runs while also breaking Sachin Tendulkar’s iconic record by scoring his 50th century, and Mohammed Shami, who emerged as the highest wicket-taker. “When Australia lost three wickets for 47 runs while chasing India’s modest total of 240, it seemed the latter had an edge, but Travis Head’s stellar knock of 137 backed by Marnus Labuschagne deprived India of its third World Cup title and gave Australia its sixth World Cup trophy,” it notes.

The editorial points out that this was the first time that India hosted the entire World Cup event. “This edition of the biggest cricketing tournament was a grand success. This sets the stage for India to host other major global sporting events in future, which will entail the development of new cities and promote various sports among their denizens,” it states. This would also break entrenched social stereotypes that still remain heavily tilted in favour of academic studies, the edit says. “But social trends are changing now and so are people’s priorities. Efforts are being made to popularise various sports. Indian players are earning laurels in several new sports, thereby signalling that the future is also bright for the country’s other sportspersons besides cricketers.”

Urdu Times

Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to media persons at the BJP’s “Diwali Milan” event at the party’s headquarters in Delhi, the Mumbai-based Urdu Times, in its editorial on November 18, writes that the PM expressed concern over the dangers of the deepfakes produced through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the crises they can pose. The PM cited his own example to say that he recently saw a video of him performing garba even though he has not done so since his school days, the edit states. “The PM’s statement has reignited a debate on the issue on social media.”

The daily says fake news is a huge problem in a country like India, which has set off several incidents of violence and even riots in which lives have been lost. “One of the common methodologies for spreading fake news on social media is the use of a wrong video for making a false claim. Deepfake is more dangerous since it is done through AI with such skill and precision that it can barely be recognised as morphed,” it says, adding that through such a hazardous technology any picture can be superimposed on any video to hit your target. The daily notes that actress Rashmika Mandanna recently became one of its victims. The AI will make the task of distinguishing truth from falsehood more challenging, with even genuine content running the risk of being dismissed as fake now, it notes.

The editorial points out that the Israel-Hamas war has spawned many videos which have polarised the world. It says many people do not have the fact-checking capabilities. In an oblique swipe at the BJP, the edit charges that its IT cell has been indulging in misinformation and that PM Modi should ask its head to curb it. “The concern flagged by PM Modi over AI-generated fake content is valid, which must be endorsed by proponents of social media.”

Referring to the upcoming voting in the remaining two poll-bound states, Telangana and Rajasthan, the Hyderabad-based Siasat, in its editorial on November 20, notes that the campaigning by the leading contenders has reached a crescendo there. In Telangana, besides the top brass of the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) — including Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR, his son and minister K T Rama Rao, and minister T Harish Rao — senior leaders of the Congress and the BJP have been engaged in making their final push, it says. “The Congress has promised several guarantees and welfare schemes for people and has also issued a manifesto. The BRS has also made pledges on similar lines. However, it seems the BJP has set aside its development agenda, looking to garner poll dividends only through polarisation.”

The daily notes that PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have led the BJP’s campaign in Telangana. “Shah also released the BJP’s manifesto, but did not announce any development scheme or programme, raking up emotive issues instead. He promised that the party will arrange for free darshan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya if the BJP is voted to power,” it says, adding that followers of other religions are also residents of Telangana. “Besides, the BJP’s manifesto promises implementation of the Uniform Civil Code.”

The editorial points out that Telangana BJP chief G Kishan Reddy has been announcing that the BJP will form a “bulldozer government” if elected. “This is unfortunate that a party like the BJP which is ruling the country is resorting to the politics of fear and polarisation, instead of projecting its achievements, to garner votes in Telangana. The BJP does not seem to have any plan or programme to offer for the development of India’s newest state,” it says, calling the party’s Telangana strategy “negative politics”. “Is Telangana not facing various problems including price rise, unemployment and lack of basic amenities?” the edit asks, adding that using a divisive plank while steering clear of such basic public issues betrays a “cynical mindset”.",Political
"Alliance talks on backburner, BJP banks on Central schemes as Akalis aim for youth in Punjab","SEASONED politicians from the BJP and Akali Dal want the two long-time friends to come together again. But, for now, this seems in suspended animation.

Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, while the SAD is trying to bank on youth to revive its political fortunes, the BJP is counting on Central schemes to strike a chord in the rural belt, a segment the saffron party had once left for its former ally to take care of.

On November 14, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal launched a ‘Global Youth Membership Drive’ under the aegis of the “Punjab di shaan, saade naujawan (Our youth the pride of Punjab)”. As part of the drive, the SAD aims to give 50% party posts to youth aged 35 or below at the district level, and 40 years or below at the state level, apart from giving them “appropriate” electoral representation.

Youth Akali Dal president Sarabjeet Singh Jhinjer told The Indian Express, “Within 24 hours of the launch of our drive, as many as 12,433 people enrolled as members.” He added that by November 20, around 32,000 people had enrolled for the drive, where anyone joining the organisation needs to give details like the constituency they live in, their phone numbers and a declaration that they aren’t facing any criminal cases.

Senior SAD leader and former Nakodar MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala said, “The party’s focus is now on the next generation. They exercise a huge voice in the decision-making within their respective families at the time of voting. The political spectrum is moved by the youth. So, for any party to remain relevant, focus on the youth is of utmost importance. Hence, the Akali move.”

Jhinjer said the youth who are enrolling would go on to be “future MPs, MLAs and members of the SGPC and zila parishads. At least 60% of the electors are youth, and they are the future leaders”.

The SAD has announced activists who enrol the highest numbers of youth will be chosen as district presidents, with 2,000 being the minimum qualifying number in a district.

The BJP, on the other hand, is focusing on beneficiaries of schemes sponsored by the Centre. Confined mostly to urban areas when it was an ally of the SAD, the Punjab BJP is now focusing heavily on rural areas, including via Shakti Kendras, to create a grassroots party cadre. To begin with, the party plans to appoint an activist each to head booths, and create a team of 15-20 volunteers at the village level.

The ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’, the party’s flagship initiative to highlight centrally sponsored schemes, was kicked off on Wednesday from Ropar and Mohali districts, to be followed by Amritsar on Thursday and culminating in Tarn Taran on December 4.

At a press conference on Monday, Union Minister of State (MoS) for Commerce Som Prakash and Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar alleged that the ruling AAP “specialises in taking credit for Central schemes and projects, where it has no singular contribution”.

Som Prakash said that Rs 1,563 crore for four-laning of the Phagwara-Mukerian road and Rs 411 crore for the rail link between Talwara and Mukerian, were both sanctioned by the Centre. He added, “The AAP even tried to take credit for the Guru Ravidass Auditorium, which was built during the previous SAD and Congress governments.”

At a meeting chaired by state BJP organisational secretary Manthri Srinivasulu in Sunam on November 14, party leaders in the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency — held by AAP CM Bhagwant Singh Mann once — were told to reach out to the beneficiaries of the Central welfare schemes and seek their support for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Addressing a press conference on November 16, Jakhar accused the AAP government of “swindling and hijacking Central schemes for the distribution of wheat”, targeting its doorstep delivery of atta programme.

He said, “Due to the AAP’s apathy, 1.41 crore beneficiaries who receive wheat under the Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana scheme launched by PM Modi will now get poor quality atta.”",Political
"‘When we contest, we fight for all. If any polarisation, it may be an organic reaction’: BJP Nathdwara candidate","Pitted against five-time Congress MLA and Assembly Speaker C P Joshi, BJP’s Vishwaraj Singh, a member of the Mewar royal family is a descendant of legendary Rajput warrior king Maharana Pratap, speaks about the coming polls. Excerpts:

Joshi has been in politics for a long time, but over the years, he has earned a reputation which I think will work to my advantage. Also, in the same Nathdwara constituency, we have Shrinathji and Haldighati (the historical battlefield where Maharana Pratap fought Mughal emperor Akbar in 1576).

* So you think your lineage is an advantage?

There is a strong bond (between the royal family and the people). This sentiment brings about a feeling of trust, which is often lacking in politics. So yes…

Advertisement

* It is believed the BJP has fielded you just keeping your lineage in mind and not performance.

The question implies that lineage does not guarantee a good performance. I strongly disagree with this. I understand that the people wanted me and hence the party chose me.

* You have been attacking Joshi. What is your promise for the Nathdwara electorate?

I am not making any personal comments against the Congress candidate. It is the general impression about the Congress here. I bring to the table what the BJP has achieved and what it hopes to in the future. Some of the key issues where I will put in my sincere efforts are increasing payments to farmers and to curb the rising price of petrol, which is the most expensive in the state.

* The Congress is banking on its welfare policies to win. How do you plan to counter it?

I disagree that the Congress has rolled out welfare policies. For four-and-a-half years, they have been squabbling over who is going to be chief minister. Announcements made over the past few months have been done keeping the upcoming elections in mind. Administratively, I do not think any of these decisions were wise. On the one hand, they are decreasing the price of LPG cylinders, but are hiking petrol prices. This is like taking money from the right pocket and keeping it in the left.

* The BJP’s constant reference to the killing of Kanhaiya Lal, which occurred in your city, is seen as a bid to polarise voters.

I don’t want to comment on whether the incident is being used to polarise voters on communal lines. When we contest elections, we fight for all communities. If there has been any polarisation, it may be an organic reaction to the incident and not the result of someone’s deliberate attempt. Also, there is no accountability regarding crimes against women in the state. The government relief in the Kanhaiya Lal case came very late and was not equal to what was given in Jaipur (in case of another killing). I don’t think things are being handled in a fair manner.

Advertisement

* You were seen as a recluse. Why this plunge into public life?

I see no reason in publicising what I do in my personal life. When it comes to politics, it is about doing something constructive and for people’s benefit. There is an appropriate time for everything. This was the time when I got an opportunity and I thought it would be correct of me to take it up.",Political
Cong veteran C P Joshi feels the heat as Maharana Pratap descendant enters the battlefield,"The old haveli at Dabiyon ka Guda, a small village about 15 km from Nathdwara in Rajsamand district of Rajasthan, is bustling with activity.

Women in colourful, traditional Rajasthani attires mill around in the courtyard while turbaned men wait outside in anticipation of “Mewarnath” Vishwaraj Singh, is a descendant of legendary warrior king Maharana Pratap and the BJP’s candidate for the upcoming Assembly elections.

With Singh in the fray, Nathdwara’s election has turned into a “clash of titans” as he is up against Assembly Speaker and veteran Congress leader C P Joshi.

Despite the “crown prince” arriving an hour late for his rally, people welcome him with drumbeats and shower petals on him even as youth among the crowd break into slogans of “Maharana Pratap ki jai”. Women greet him with aarti before he enters the haveli and pays obeisance to the deity in the temple inside.

Singh then takes a seat on the platform outside as people, whose names are announced along with their clan, come forward to garland him and touch his feet as a mark of respect.

On the personal front, a soft-spoken Singh exhibits humility but the underscoring of Mewari traditions in his campaign is unmistakable.

In his address, apart from attacking the Congress on its “misgovernance”, the BJP candidate emphasises to the people that his relationship with them is 1,400 years old and stresses on how people across community lines fought together under Maharana Pratap.

Local leaders at the Congress’s campaign office in Nathdwara say Joshi is going village to village to highlight the developmental work that he has undertaken in the constituency. “The BJP has nothing to show for ground work. They are playing the sentiment card and hence their campaign revolves around the Mewar king and Shri Ram,” a Congress leader says.

Going into the election, the Congress will also have Joshi’s electoral past in mind. The Assembly Speaker, who has won from Nathdwara five times since 1985, led the party to victory as state president in 2008 but lost his seat by a single vote to the BJP’s Kalyan Singh Chauhan. It is widely believed that Joshi’s aspirations of becoming CM vanished with the defeat.

Caste conundrum

A key factor that is likely to influence the electoral outcome in Nathdwara is the caste composition of the electorate. Rajputs alone make up 30% of the voters while Brahmins are 15%. The BJP, by fielding the Mewar royal, is hoping that the Rajput pride translates into votes in its favour.

The preference of candidates based on caste seems to be evident on the ground too. While conceding that Joshi, a Brahmin, has done a lot of work in the constituency, Mahipal Singh, a Rajput, throws his weight behind Vishwaraj Singh.

Also Read | Both BJP and Congress have failed women in Rajasthan

“Nathdwara is more developed than the district headquarters, Rajsamand. Joshi, a tall leader, made the government focus on the constituency. But now Raja (Vishwaraj Singh) is here and the sentiment of the people is attached to him. Joshiji would have won hands down if Vishwaraj Singh was not in the picture. Who knows Raja may settle down here if he wins?” Mahipal Singh says. Many other voters of the Rajput community echo the shopkeeper’s views.

A section of Brahmin voters too appear eager to throw their weight behind Vishwaraj Singh. Home guard Manoj Paliwal says people will go with the royal as they hold him in high regard, despite Joshi’s contributions.

The pro-royal sentiment, however, wanes among OBCs and tribals, who also make up a significant chunk – around 40% – of the electorate.

In Siswi ki Dandi village, where Vishwaraj Singh addresses a gathering of Rehbaris and Salvis – both OBCs – the crowd accords him a grand welcome, but begins speaking of Joshi’s good work moments after he leaves.

“Do not go by the way we welcomed him. We are a village of camel herders and have a long association with the royal family. We revere them. The family has historically suffered a lot to keep Islamic rulers at bay,” says Tulsi Ram, who belongs to the Rehbari community, adding: “But we cannot forget the work Joshiji has done for us.”

In Semal village, close to the legendary battlefield of Haldighati, where Maharana Pratap faced off against Mughal emperor Akbar in 1576, Kamal Sain says the lingering question is whether Vishwaraj Singh will be available when the people need him.

“No one knows the Maharaja. Will he meet us and get our work done? A few years ago, when we needed a school in the village, we asked Joshi, who got orders passed for the school in a day,” Sain, who belongs to the Nai (OBC) community, says.

In tribal-dominated Udan village near Nathdwara town, Bhimrai says he doesn’t know the government but is aware of Joshi. Bhimrai, who belongs to the Bhil community, says he will vote for the veteran Congress leader.

Joshi, however, is feeling the heat from the BJP. A look at the list of public events to be attended by the BJP and Congress candidates on Monday tells a story. While Vishwaraj Singh was slated to visit 13 places, Joshi was slated to visit 39.",Political
"‘Redemption’ for BJP leader whose case led to Rahul Gandhi conviction, Purnesh Modi gets charge of UT","Purnesh Modi’s appointment as the BJP’s incharge for the Union Territory of Daman, Diu, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli follows his criminal defamation suit against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, which subsequently led to his conviction and brief disqualification as a Lok Sabha MP.

Given that Purnesh had been unceremoniously shunned out of his ministry months ahead of the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections, the appointment is also being perceived as “redemption” for the leader, if not a “reward” for the case he won against Rahul.

Purnesh will hold the post of UT in-charge for three years, and said his primary focus will be to ensure the party’s victory in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

“I will work with local teams and strengthen the party at the grassroots level (booth level) to ensure electoral benefits for the BJP. We believe power can be attained through a strong organisation. My focus will lie on booth-level political and micro management,” he said.

The Dadra & Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat is currently held by Kalaben Delkar, the widow of former seven-time MP Mohan Delkar, who died of suspected suicide in a Mumbai hotel in 2021. Delkar, an influential tribal leader, had won the seat as an Independent in 2019, but had later moved to the JD(U). His wife was elected as MP in November 2021 on a Shiv Sena ticket.

The other Lok Sabha seat in the UT is held by the BJP’s Lalu Patel.

Delkar’s death had led to consternation in the BJP ranks as the Daman, Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli UT administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, was among the nine people named in the abetment to suicide case. The Bombay High Court had later quashed the case. Khoda Patel was also given additional charge as the Administrator of Lakshadweep.

BJP leaders believe that Purnesh’s Gujarati roots will help the party in the two Lok Sabha constituencies, which are geographically connected to Gujarat, especially in the Delkar stronghold of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. “His appointment has spread a positive wave among party leaders and workers. This is the first time that a Gujarati has been appointed as incharge. Local leaders and workers were less interested in working with former incharges like Vinod Sonkar and Vidhya Rahatkar,” senior BJP leader Dipak Jadhav, who has been associated with the party in the region for 33 years, said.

An OBC leader, Purnesh was minister for roads in the previous Bhupendra Patel Cabinet before he was stripped of his berth in August 2022. He has been an active member of the BJP in Surat for over two decades, and he has impressed with his organisational skills as BJP Surat city unit for two terms between 2010 and 2016.

He won his first Assembly election in a 2012 bypoll from Surat West, following the demise of sitting MLA Kishor Vankawala. He went on to win the seat again in 2017 and 2022.

According to some sources, Purnesh’s appointment might ease his way onto the national scene.

Purnesh had filed a criminal defamation case against Rahul Gandhi in a Surat court in 2019 over the Congress leader’s remark implying that all thieves were called Modi, at a rally in Karnataka’s Kolar. On March 23 this year, Chief Judicial Magistrate H H Varma convicted Rahul, leading to his disqualification as a Lok Sabha MP. In August, the Supreme Court stayed the Congress leader’s conviction, following which he was reinstated as an MP.

As UT in-charge, Purnesh says he hopes to connect the organisation and the administration. “We cannot interfere with the administration, but can develop a cordial relationship. We will definitely win the upcoming elections once a strong organisational base is established,” he says.",Political
"Farm to jobs, women to schoolkids, health to LPG: Spot the difference in Cong, BJP manifestos","The Congress on Tuesday announced its manifesto for Rajasthan promising a law to ensure Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, doubling the insurance sum under the flagship Chiranjeevi health insurance from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, 10 lakh jobs in the next five years, including 4 lakh government jobs, as well as CCTV cameras in public places for women safety.

Other big announcements include bringing the Vidhan Parishad to Rajasthan “for wider participation,” “stringent legal measures for hate speech” and constitution of “reconciliation and camaraderie committees at the district level to address hatred and enmity between communities.”

Releasing the manifesto, party president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “We make only those promises which we can fulfil, be it in the Centre or states,” claiming that the Congress government fulfilled 95 per cent promises of its last manifesto for the state.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that as many as 3.32 crore people had given online and offline suggestions for the ‘Vision 2030’ document, which also became the basis for the party’s manifesto.

The Congress’s promise of “stringent legal measures for hate speech” comes at a time when the BJP, which released its manifesto for Rajasthan last week, has promised to set up a special cell to investigate ‘anti-Bharat’ sleeper cells across the state.

Among the Congress’s immediate priorities after coming to power, those for farmers include a promise to enact a law to implement the MSP, to be called the Minimum Support Price Guarantee Act, which will implement the Swaminathan Committee’s recommendations. The government will also provide an interest-free agricultural loan facility of up to Rs 2 lakh to all farmers from cooperative banks and withdraw pending cases against farmers related to their participation in protests.

Gehlot said that the government will also form a commission, headed by a high court judge, which will hold a hearing before taking a decision on seizing farmlands.

Similarly, at the release of BJP’s manifesto last week, BJP president J P Nadda had claimed that the land of 19,400 farmers has been seized and that the party will formulate a policy to ensure such farmers are compensated. The BJP manifesto had also stated that a notification to ensure that no farmlands are seized will be brought out in addition to an MSP of Rs 2,700 per quintal for wheat.

For youth, the Congress says it will create 10 lakh employment opportunities in five years, out of which 4 lakh employment opportunities will be in the government sector. Additionally, a new scheme for the recruitment of youngsters at the panchayat level, gradually merging with government vacancies, will also be formulated. Moreover, the government will start a toll-free call centre and an e-Employment Exchange.

In comparison, the BJP has promised 2.5 lakh jobs in the next five years as well as the setting up of a Rajasthan Institute of Medical Sciences and Rajasthan Institute of Technology – modelled on AIIMS and IITs – in each division, among several other measures.

The Congress has also promised to increase the maximum number of employment days under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and Indira Gandhi Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (IGUEGS) to 150 days annually, up from 125 days currently.

For women’s safety, the Congress promises it will ensure installation of CCTV cameras in public places and security guards will be appointed in every village and urban ward. The party also promises to take necessary steps to reduce the average investigation time in sexual harassment cases and ensure 33 per cent reservation for women in cooperative institutions as well as in the police force.

The BJP too had promised 33 per cent reservation of women in the police force, a women’s police station in every district, constitution of anti-Romeo squads, etc.

The Congress also promises to provide a free coupon every month for free travel for women in the state-owned buses, in addition to existing discounts, and says it will come up with a scheme for special leave to be availed by women during their menstrual cycle.

The Congress had earlier announced Rs 10,000 per annum for women heads of households while BJP had announced the Lado Protsahan Yojana where the government will provide a savings bond of Rs 2 lakh for a girl child.

The Congress has repeated that it will conduct a caste census “to accurately determine population and allocate benefits for informed decisions on affirmative action”.

For education, Congress says that it will provide education facilities till Class 12, instead of till Class 8, under the Right to Education (RTE) by bringing an education guarantee law in the state. The party had earlier announced free laptops or tablets for first-year students of government colleges and free English-medium school education.

The BJP has promised Rs 1,200 as direct benefit transfer to schoolchildren from economically weaker sections for their school bags, books and uniforms.

In the health sector, the Congress government will increase the amount of Mukhyamantri Nishulk Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana from the current Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh annually and also include ‘In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) package’ under this scheme “realising the profound emotional and social challenges faced by couples deprived of the joy of parenthood”.

The party has also promised it will increase the facilities under free OPD/IPD in government medical institutions at the district and block levels.

The BJP, meanwhile, has promised to launch the Rs 40,000 crore Bhamashah Health Infrastructure Mission to expand and upgrade health infrastructure in the state. It has also promised to set up 350 Jan Aushadi Kendras and at least one medical college in each district. Recruitment of 15,000 doctors and 20,000 paramedical staff along with adding 6,000 medical seats are also among promises made by the BJP in its manifesto.

For businessmen, Congress has promised it will bring a ‘Vyapari Credit Card Scheme’, similar to the Kisan Credit Card Scheme, which will provide interest-free loans up to Rs 5 lakh to small traders, shopkeepers and young entrepreneurs.

The Gig Workers Welfare Act will be amended to include auto and taxi drivers, “creating a more inclusive welfare system”. For good governance, the party promises to enact an “Accountability and Auto Service Delivery Act” which has been long demanded by social activists in Rajasthan.

For LPG gas cylinders, the government had already announced that the Rs 500 subsidised cylinder will be extended to families under the NFSA (National Food Security Act) and BPL (Below Poverty Line) categories too. Now, the price has been reduced to Rs 400. In its manifesto, the BJP had announced cylinders at Rs 450.

While Congress says it will implement measures and stringent punishments to curb incidents of paper leaks, BJP had announced it will set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate paper leaks during Congress rule.

The Congress party had earlier announced a law to back the Old Pension Scheme with law and strengthen it. Moreover, a Congress government, if elected, will continue its schemes such as smartphones with internet for women.

Moreover, it will modify the percentage of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs in accordance with the actual population to be enumerated in the census.

Decoding Politics: Why Muslim quota is sparking fireworks in Telangana fray,"In its campaign for the Telangana Assembly polls, the BJP has repeatedly raised the issue of the existing Muslim reservation in the state, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah calling it “unconstitutional” while maintaining that it will be abolished if the BJP wins the election.

Addressing a poll rally at Jangaon on Monday, Shah said, “BJP is the party of Telangana people. When BJP forms government in Telangana we will abolish the unconstitutional 4% Muslim reservation.” He also repeated the BJP’s pledge to appoint a backward class (BC) leader as the CM if voted to power in the November 30 Assembly polls.

Last Saturday, in his speech at a rally in Gadwal, Shah promised to scrap religion-based reservation and increase the quota of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) if the BJP clinches the election. He also accused the Congress and the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) of being “anti-BC” parties while claiming that only the BJP could benefit the backwards.

BJP manifesto

The issue also figured in the BJP’s manifesto released by Shah in Hyderabad last Saturday, which besides several freebies also promised implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC).

The party’s manifesto, titled “Sakala Janula Saubhagya Telangana (welfare of the people)”, says that it would remove “unconstitutional” religion-based reservation, including the 4% quota for Muslims, in government jobs and seats in state educational institutes. The Muslim quota would be redistributed to OBCs, SCs, and STs, the manifesto states, adding that the party will set up a committee to draft a UCC for the state.

Congress’s ‘Minority Declaration’

On November 9, the Telangana Congress released its “Minority Declaration” for the polls, promising to increase the state annual minority welfare budget to Rs 4,000 crore. The party also pledged to conduct the caste survey within six months of coming to power in the state.

The “Minority Declaration” stated that the Congress will ensure fair reservation for all backward classes, including minorities, in jobs, education and government schemes.

Stand of Congress, BRS, AIMIM

Soon after Shah first raked up the Muslim quota at a rally at Chevella on the outskirts of Hyderabad in April this year, the Congress as well as the BRS and the AIMIM accused him of “undermining” the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court before which the issue has been pending.

Senior Telangana Congress leader and ex-minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir has maintained that the 4% Muslim quota in jobs and education for socially and economically backward Muslims under the BC-E category is being implemented in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh based on the stay granted by the Supreme Court.

He has said that the 4% Muslim reservation – announced by the then Y S Rajashekar Reddy government after the Congress stormed to power in the united Andhra Pradesh in 2004 – encompasses only 14 socially and economically backward groups among Muslims, identified by a Backward Classes Commission without affecting the quota of other communities.

Shabbir has alleged that the BJP leaders have been attempting to “distort” these points to mislead the public and incite communal hatred.

AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has charged that Shah’s remarks exposed the BJP’s “double standards”. “On the one hand, Prime Minister Naredra Modi talks of reaching out to backward Muslims like Pasmandas and, on the other, the Union Home Minister announces that they will cancel Muslim reservation,” he said.

What had the BJP to offer Telangana bar anti-Muslim “hate speeches”, Owaisi alleged, adding that the BJP-led Centre should instead amend laws to remove the overall 50% quota ceiling.

BRS spokesperson Ravula Sridhar Reddy said Shah’s statement was another sign that “the BJP is greedy to grab power by any means”. “Amit Shah has turned the Muslim quota into a religious issue. He does not know the difference between constitutional and unconstitutional quota because the 4% quota is constitutional and does not breach the 50% ceiling,” Reddy said.

In April 2017, in keeping with a poll promise, the BRS government led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR passed a Bill to increase quota for STs from 6% to 10%, and for Muslims from 4% to 12%, which would breach the 50% ceiling. But the Bill remains stuck as the Centre has not cleared it.",Political
Trouble in Karnataka BJP as senior leaders revolt over Yediyurappa’s continuing grip,"At least some prominent leaders of Karnataka BJP are unhappy that former chief minister and party Parliamentary board member B S Yediyurappa is back in the driver’s seat of the state unit, having installed his son and first-time MLA B Y Vijayendra as its president, as well as loyalist R Ashoka as Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the state Assembly.

Over the past week, BJP MLAs Basangouda Patil Yatnal and Arvind Bellad, as well as former state ministers C T Ravi and Arvind Limbavali, have criticised these appointments. Yatnal, who has a history of lashing out at Yediyurappa and Vijayendra, said he had informed the central observers about “those who were disloyal to the party” and made “adjustments” with the Opposition during the Assembly polls earlier this year.

Though there are fears that sidelining these leaders could be counterproductive, party leaders dismissed these, claiming that come the Lok Sabha polls, everyone would be found working for the party’s success.

Jarange-Patil on CM Shinde’s turf

Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange-Patil will hold a rally in Thane, the bastion of Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. The announcement of his visit was made by the Sakal Maratha Samaj.

Jarange-Patil’s visit comes close on the heels of an all-party OBC Elgar rally held to protest against the demand for inclusion of Marathas in the OBC category. The meeting saw state civil supplies minister and NCP MLA Chaggan Bhujbal steal the show, deploying rhetoric that no one from the ruling NDA has so far used since the Maratha agitation was reignited on August 29, as reported by Manoj Dattatrye More. Much of Bhujbal’s attack was reserved for Jarange-Patil, who has been spearheading the community’s demand for reservation.

The Maratha activist’s visit to Thane is a part of his statewide tour, scheduled to culminate on December 24, the deadline set by him for the Shinde government to give Kunbi certificates for members of the Maratha community from across the state.
